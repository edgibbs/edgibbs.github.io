I&#8217;ve latched on to the Pragmatic&#8217;s suggestion to pick up a new language each year. This year it was Ruby of course. A couple things from Smalltalk to Lisp to Haskell have been buzzing around in my head, but I think I&#8217;ve settled on Haskell as the candidate. The main reason is being a functional language it has the ability to stretch my skills the most.
