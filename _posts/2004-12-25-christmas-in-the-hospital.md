Not much different from Christmas in prison.

I&#8217;m a little blue now. I miss watching Kassie open her presents and pontificate on that this is the best ever present. Kassie and Molly are coming by for a real short visit, but it should be great. I haven&#8217;t seen them in about 10 days now. I really hope they get here soon.

Anyway my white counts are creeping up to 0.9 so I&#8217;m guessing 12/28 for a release date, kind of like onto parole at home.
