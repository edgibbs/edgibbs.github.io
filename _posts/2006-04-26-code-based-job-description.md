You don&#8217;t come across a developer [job posting](http://www.cornetdesign.com/2006/04/great-job-posting.html) quite this creative all that often (courtesy [Cory Foy](http://www.cornetdesign.com/) via the XP mailing list). I love the idea of doing a code based job posting, but I&#8217;m not sure you could swing it by your average Fortune 500 HR department.

My personal favorite statement:

<pre>assertTrue(candidate.practiceTDD());
</pre>

And my favorite method, that I think is too often overlooked in really good candidates is:

<pre>public void testTeachingSkills() {
  assertTrue(candidate.canImproveTeamSkills());
  assertTrue(candidate.canArgueAboutAgility());
}
</pre>
