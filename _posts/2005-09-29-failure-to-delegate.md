Sometimes your inadequacies hit you over your head. I got a call on my cell phone about 4:00 today. The developer on the other end asked if there was anything for him to do. I had to answer no, and I&#8217;m fighting so many fires I don&#8217;t have time to stop and help him figure out what to do. Lucky for me he&#8217;s conscientious and just taking the day off tomorrow. I&#8217;ve been a manager several years now, but I still find delegation difficult in many circumstances.
