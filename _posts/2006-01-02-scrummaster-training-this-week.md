I&#8217;m headed off to Seattle this week for some certified ScrumMaster training with Ken Schwaber. I should be able to glean a lot of ideas off the fellow participants experiences as well as Ken&#8217;s. One of my biggest questions is how to go about integrating Scrum when many of the projects we work on are small from a developer perspective, typically just two developers.
