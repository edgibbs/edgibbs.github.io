My WBC is up to 0.8. No major news today. Since my counts leveled off I&#8217;m looking at going home later in the week, but they could still suprise me. I&#8217;d really like to go home, but I&#8217;m trying to be patient. I should actually get to do some coding today, which will be nice for a change.
