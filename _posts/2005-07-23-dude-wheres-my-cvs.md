I&#8217;d been tooling around looking at CVS hosting options since I&#8217;m doing some hobbyist type development with a friend. Turns out in the preface for [Spring in Action](http://www.manning.com/books/walls2), one of the authors thanks [CVSDude](http://www.cvsdude.org/). 2 MB and one account login for free, 200 MB and 5 accounts for $10 bucks a month, sounds about right.
