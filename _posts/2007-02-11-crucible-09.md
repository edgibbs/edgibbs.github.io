Over the weekend I upgraded [Crucible](http://www.cenqua.com/crucible/), our code review tool, to the [0.9 release](http://www.cenqua.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=2740&tstart=0). Looks like it&#8217;s nearing 1.0 readiness. When I upgraded it on Saturday night I noticed they fixed an annoying bug where you couldn&#8217;t just delete a review. We had a few test reviews in the system that we wanted to delete since we were just showing people how it worked.

Deleting away I realized we&#8217;ve been doing less reviews over the past two months or so. Code reviews are not exactly your stickiest developer practice without some coaxing. It also makes a good point why pair programming especially with rotating pairs can be a really effective way to actually have a high level of code review. Since pairing is still very optional in our shop we&#8217;ll be using Crucible for a long time to come.
