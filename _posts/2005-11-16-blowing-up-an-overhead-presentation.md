This Monday as I was typing my way through a demo in front of 7 developers I noticed as I made typos, etc, that most of the comments were coming from the front row. Turns out after I talked to several people in the class that it was hard to read code in 12pt type at 1024&#215;768, especially from the back row. 

So far I&#8217;ve found two fixes. I can change the default font size to about 16pt in IntelliJ IDEA or since I&#8217;m on a Mac I can set the universal accessibility option to zoom to about 1.5 times when I hit the Apple-option-equals combo. I&#8217;ll probably just go with the 16pt size option though
