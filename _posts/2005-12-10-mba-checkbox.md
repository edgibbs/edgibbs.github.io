I&#8217;ve been debating on whether I should pursue an MBA at this point in my career. I&#8217;ve even gone so far as to attend an informational session at the local UC. I&#8217;d like to eventually take on the challenges and headaches of being a CIO/CTO, and obviously there is some value to having an MBA.

Some quick research pulls up the following:

> About [25 percent](http://www.ciostrategycenter.com/darwin/Board/initiatives/import_mba/) of the members of The Working Council for CIOs have MBAs.

So apparently it&#8217;s not critical for my future statistically. Still there is the lure of academia, possibly working with a great professor on interesting research, fellow students allowing for some great networking, and forcing myself to branch out on the business side.

Still there&#8217;s a lot of other factors such as:

  * My wife just finished 3 years of law school and it&#8217;s nice to have two incomes again.
  * We already have school loans to pay.
  * We have two small children who need a lot of attention.
  * I already have one advanced degree.

The convincing factor to put it off into the future is that I&#8217;m already a software development manager and I love my job even with the headaches. So if I was a developer and I wanted to move ahead it might be a lot more compelling to take on the debt. I still need to branch out more on the business side, but I did several stints in professional services so I&#8217;ve seen quite a few industries and worked on projects in them. I&#8217;ve also done pretty much every IT role including architect, PM, business analyst, QA lead, and sysadmin.

And anyway I feel a little old for it. All my friends who&#8217;ve gotten MBAs did it a few years back generally without kids and sometimes without significant others.
