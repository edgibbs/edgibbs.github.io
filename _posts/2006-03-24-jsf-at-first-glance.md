[Richard Monson-Haefel](http://rmh.blogs.com/weblog/) blogs about [looking into JSF](http://rmh.blogs.com/weblog/2006/03/daytoday_javase.html). Some of his comments include:

> &#8220;It really seems complicated to me in terms of configuration, debugging, and such things.&#8221;

> &#8220;JSF strikes me as an over-engineered solution that meets the needs of a small percentage of enterprise web sites.&#8221;

Appears to be seeing JSF for what it is right now. Interesting technology that isn&#8217;t that cleanly implemented. I really wonder how well JSF will succeed out in the world unless they can fix some of the difficulties with logging, debugging, and unit testing. That said we&#8217;re still pushing hard to make it work on several projects. One developer even mused recently that using a component with some built-in paging functionality, finally made him feel like there was something positive in JSF.
