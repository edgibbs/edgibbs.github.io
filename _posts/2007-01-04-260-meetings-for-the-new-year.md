Setting up one-on-ones today:

  * 10 employees.
  * 1 30 minute one-on-one per employee per week.
  * 6 months of meetings scheduled through the end of June.

Turns out this is 260 meetings over the next six months. The raw number of meetings would be enough to send the average developer running to Monster. Luckily the one-on-ones are really a handy tool to make sure at a minimum everyone gets at least 30 uninterrupted minutes with their manager to communicate concerns up, get help, vent, and get coaching or mentoring.
