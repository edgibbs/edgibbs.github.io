I came across yet more anecdotal evidence that actual JSF adoptions are coming along pretty slowly, from some commentary by [Greg Luck](http://gregluck.com/blog/archives/2005/08/oreilly_open_so.html). During a session on web frameworks with Craig McClanahan and Matt Raible at O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s Open Source Conference apparently a question was asked about who in the audience was using JSF: 

> It is a little unclear what will happen with JSF. It has been coming for a long time, but only one person in the audience was using it.

This points again towards the idea that despite all the talk about JSF, there are still few people using it. And I&#8217;ll probably get flamed about this since the technology has some hardcore true believers. For me it&#8217;s on the wait and see list of new technologies. I&#8217;m still not convinced its worth the effort to adopt and that something better is likely to come along.
