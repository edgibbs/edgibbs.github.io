About a year ago now I acquired a Seiki SE39UY04 37&#8243; 4K TV as a monitor. Despite the 30Hz refresh rate and once or twice a day screen reset for 5 seconds it&#8217;s the best monitor I&#8217;ve ever worked on. A 4K display is an almost infinite amount of screen real estate. I regularly have 4 files up in vim displaying over 120 lines each. At $400 dollars it was a great way to jump into 4K and wait until the really good 4K monitors show up down the line.

Pros:

  * 4 HD screens of stuff, regular have 4 1080P screens up on a single monitor.
  * If you&#8217;re not gaming the 30Hz refresh rate has much less downside.
  * It&#8217;s cheap enough that you won&#8217;t feel bad when you replace it a year or two down the road.
  * It doubles as a 4K TV.
  * After a year it hasn&#8217;t had any glitches.
  * I can remote pair and still have 60-75% of my screen available.

Cons:

  * 30 Hz is pretty noticeable at first and for gaming/fast updating.
  * To share for pairing you generally need to drop the resolution down from 4K.
  * It goes black a few times a day for a few seconds.
  * It doesn&#8217;t really sleep since it&#8217;s not a monitor.
  * Picture quality is fine for development work, but not great.
  * It&#8217;s hard to see co-workers around it.
  * If you share screens you&#8217;re constantly downsizing the resolution since almost no-one else has 4K yet.
