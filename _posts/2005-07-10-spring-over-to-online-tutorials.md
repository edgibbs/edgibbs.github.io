After another frustrating session with the example code in [Spring: A Developer&#8217;s Notebook](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/springadn/) was the last straw. As a manager I don&#8217;t really code for a living anymore. On good days I get to do some coding at work, but often the day can be eaten up with meetings and taking care of problems so my programmers can work relatively interruption free.

My goal is to always stay technical, but what that means is spending a lot of my own time after hours coding, reviewing tools and frameworks, and keeping up with things like this blog. Add in that I have a family with two young daughters and I don&#8217;t have time for much else. So when some example code goes wrong it&#8217;s doubly frustrating.

So I&#8217;m off to try some online Spring tutorials at [Zabada Technology](http://www.zabada.com/technology/Wiki.jsp?page=SpringRecipes).
