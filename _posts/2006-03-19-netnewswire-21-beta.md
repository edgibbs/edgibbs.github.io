Just downloaded and installed the newest version of [NetNewsWire 2.1 Beta](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php). In the first 5 seconds it solved one of my most annoying problems with prior versions. When you click on a link for more&#8230; NetNewsWire opens a new tab which is really a session of Safari.

Since I rarely go through and close all these windows they tend to build up often I&#8217;ll have 50 to 100 tabs opening. In prior versions when things got slow I&#8217;d chose

<div class="codecolorer-container text vibrant overflow-off" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          Window > Close All Tabs
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

. That worked fine, but it would launch the dreaded spinning beach ball and take at least 2-3 minutes to finish. Annoying, but I eventually got used to it.

I just closed 68+ windows in 2 seconds. Very nice. (And I still haven&#8217;t tried out the real power feature, syncing online through [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com/home.aspx).)
