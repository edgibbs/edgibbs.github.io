After googling around tonight I&#8217;m beginning to think our experiments trying to do Agile with mainframe development are extremely rare. That&#8217;s right we actually have at least one pure Agile mainframe project. Apparently it&#8217;s fallen into more on an [iterative waterfall](http://danube.com/blog/kanemar/the_staggered_iterative_waterfall_anti_pattern_part_1.html) approach, but we are almost off the bleeding edge on this one.

I&#8217;d love to hear about anyone else&#8217;s experiments around this, but I fear we may be almost alone on it.
