Recently Uncle Bob [talked about](http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2007/12/13/business-software-is-messy-and-mgly) a manager who constantly choose short term hacking over anything else defending the decision with the idea that &#8220;business software is ugly.&#8221; Uncle Bob came up with a good argument to make: 

> One of the developers asked the question point blank: &ldquo;What do you do when your managers tell you to make a mess?&rdquo; I responded: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t take it. Behave like a doctor who&rsquo;s hospital administrator has just told him that hand-washing is too expensive, and he should stop doing it.&rdquo; 

For many developers trained through experience that speed is more important than quality it&#8217;s difficult to resist being asked to develop a feature faster. Hacking just adds debt and slows down future development. It&#8217;s the sort of thing where an application has gotten so complex and hairy that a developer new to the project can&#8217;t even be productive for a month or two. Just getting up to speed on how the beast has been hacked together wastes weeks of time.

Kudos to Uncle Bob for using a powerful analogy to make people think.
