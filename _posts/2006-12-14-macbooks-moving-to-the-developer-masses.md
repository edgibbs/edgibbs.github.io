Macs have been gaining a strong foothold among your leading edge developers especially in the Java world for a while, but a few nights back at the local java users group I glanced around and noticed:

  * 3 Macbook Pros
  * 2 Macbooks
  * 1 iBook
  * 2 Windows laptops

Maybe Macs are crossing the [chasm](http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~fmb/articles/lifecycle/) from innovators and early adopters to an early majority.
