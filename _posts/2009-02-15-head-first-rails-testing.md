> Automated testing is one of the most important parts of software development, and yet until now, we haven&#8217;t mentioned it. Testing a piece of software relies on a thorough understanding of the tools you are using, and designing tests can be far more difficult (and enjoyable) than writing the code itself.

Despite Rails effort in making testing easy the Head First Rails book ignores testing altogether until a slight mention on one of the very last pages of the book. I perused the index hoping I was wrong, but the author spells out that it was a deliberate decision. 

I have a lot of respect for the Head First books as a great way to jump in and learn something new. I&#8217;ve [posted](http://edgibbs.com/2008/01/07/mainstream-agile-with-xp/) before about how impressed I was when Head First Software Development went into depth on Agile and testing. Here I&#8217;m just saddened by the decision. Even a short appendix with a few examples might have sufficed if not examples throughout or a dedicated chapter. All the other Rails books I&#8217;ve come across at least devote some time to the testing conversation.
