Bruce Eckel [related](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=167363) some enlightening evidence that many organizations aren&#8217;t comfortable bringing in a high end experience consultant to help review their code and architectures:
  
Reference 

> In all the years that I have offered design reviews, code reviews, and walkthroughs, only one client has ever used these services.

I can second that anecdotal advice. In about five years of doing professional services I only had one client who ever brought us in to review their architecture. The sad reality is there is really valuable information to be gleaned through this process, but very few organizations are up to using it. Much easier to send some people to a training class or bring in a contractor to cover a narrow role on a single project.

If you bring in a consultant to review your code and design they just might tell you that something is wrong, and that&#8217;s difficult.
