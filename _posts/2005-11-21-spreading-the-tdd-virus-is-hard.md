> &#8220;Oh, if we&#8217;re going to hook the project up to cruisecontrol I better write some tests.&#8221; &#8211;An Unnamed Developer

I&#8217;m not sure the fact that I spent a day doing a class on TDD last week has completely sunk in. Tomorrow I hook up cruisecontrol and maybe do some pairing so we can make some progress on this front. Maybe it&#8217;s time to invoke harsh measures and start failing the projects for not enough test coverage. I might feel like an ogre, but at least I&#8217;ll be a test first ogre.
