I&#8217;ve watched my company begin to understand that they can cancel software projects. From what I can tell this is relatively new to the culture. Though no one truly likes to be on a cancelled project, it&#8217;s a whole lot better than delivering a project 3 years later that doesn&#8217;t even have a single customer.

So in the last month I&#8217;ve seen at least two projects cancelled:

  * One because a third party software system coming online duplicated the custom application functionality. This one got canceled after the first Sprint had kicked off, but better than nothing.
  * Another because the business drivers behind the project have evaporated. This was a successful project with multiple phases delivered, but they&#8217;ve now decided that the lowest priority phase is not worth doing and that the product is complete.

Both of these are signs that we&#8217;re starting to get Agile a bit and that we&#8217;re understanding the power of failing fast instead of marching along to an inevitable disaster.
