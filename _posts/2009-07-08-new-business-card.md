The picture pretty much speaks for itself. I haven&#8217;t had to make business cards on my own in years, but [Zazzle](http://www.zazzle.com/) made it pretty simple to do online. I created the logo at [faceyourmanga.it](http://www.faceyourmanga.it/welcome.htm). Even in the days of the web a card can have some impact.
