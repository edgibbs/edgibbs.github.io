As a project manager on dozens of projects I have sent hundreds or perhaps thousands of project status reports. I&#8217;ve read even more status reports as a development manager often showing up Friday afternoons in the old inbox.

Every status report needs to cover the basics like budget, scope, and schedule. Other than that the big thing is to point out new risks or items that have been mitigated. In an Agile context the status reports can often be eliminated entirely, but it tends to be a document people hold onto when getting adjusted to Agile. They often looks like paper versions of dashboards with the traditional red/yellow/green designations. All green means no need to read. Then again I once worked for a director who was actually color blind so I&#8217;d make sure the colors are also spelled out.

As a PM I remember borrowing my first status template from another PM who had in turn adopted it from her time at Andersen Consulting (Accenture after the rebranding). I adjusted it, but I&#8217;ve used it ever since. I can&#8217;t say I have a favorite format for project status reports, but I do know they need to communicate the key points as succinctly as possible. As a PM it&#8217;s important to know who&#8217;s going to actually read these reports. Some of your audience much prefers to here a verbal update even if it&#8217;s very short. 

As a manager the best approach to status reports is to stay directly connected with your projects so you don&#8217;t need to rely on them. You should be spending a significant portion of time with the bigger projects or the projects that are struggling potentially only relying on status reports for the well oiled smaller projects that are just getting done. And don&#8217;t forget to reward those projects that are just getting done right without much need of your services. These are the well managed projects that should be rewarded more often.

Finally, I think I should expand on email and status reports. As managers you typically get 150-200+ emails a day many CCed or forwarded to you as an FYI. When you send that very detailed status report as a Word attachment much of your audience will never read it. I realize PMs often spend a painful 30-60 minutes tweaking the status report to send out every week only for it to go almost completely unread. What I really want is the key points of the status report directly in the email. That means you can send the attachment, but make sure you copy the critical stuff into the body of the email. The pain involved in not being able to read it in the preview pane, having to click on the attachment, wait a few seconds for Word to bring it up and render it just to start reading that nothing critical really happened this week often isn&#8217;t worth it. And an email link to the status report buried in project server is rarely any better. So, please don&#8217;t rely on attachments.
