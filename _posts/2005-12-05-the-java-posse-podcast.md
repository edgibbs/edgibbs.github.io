After a bit of a restart from the ashes of the Javacast, the [Java Posse Podcast](http://javaposse.com/) has taken up in it&#8217;s wake. I like it overall, but it can have a bit of Java boosterism to it. Still they get some pretty great interviews including [Joshua Bloch](http://javaposse.com/index.php?post_id=29225) recently. So if you don&#8217;t mind a bit of a Java bias it&#8217;s a pretty good development podcast. I pick up little things from the hosts every once in a while, things like one of the hosts regularly uses multiple Java IDEs instead of spending the day in a single IDE.
