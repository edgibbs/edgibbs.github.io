Last week I filled out a purchase order for [Clover](http://www.cenqua.com/clover/) after some evaluation of various unit testing code coverage tools. I went with Clover because $1500 for the server edition isn&#8217;t really that significant a cost even if the experiment doesn&#8217;t work out. So starting next week we&#8217;ll be running code coverage reports with our ongoing projects. I expect the feedback loop to be pretty helpful. I&#8217;ll be really happy at first if we can get 50% coverage at first on average.
