May 23rd from 6:30-9:00pm the first Sacramento Ruby User Group Meeting was held at the [Invision Design and Development](http://invisionddg.com/) offices in Old Sacramento. In attendance:

  * Ryan &#8211; a full time Rails developer with [Invision](http://invisionddg.com/).
  * Layton &#8211; a Rails developer.
  * Tom Mornini &#8211; CTO of [EngineYard](http://www.engineyard.com/).
  * Ed Gibbs &#8211; author of this blog.

No planned agenda. No sponsored pizza and snacks. No presentations. Plenty of good conversation. I got in a little late, but the group had been discussing Rails Conf 2007. All of them were able to attend, though Tom went as a vendor so he didn&#8217;t really get to attend sessions.

The topics ranged from Django versus Rails to virtual hosting. Tom shared a few items about EngineYard, our local successful Rails startup:

  * He recently hired [Evan Phoenix](http://blog.fallingsnow.net/) of the [Rubinius](http://rubini.us/) project to create a pure Ruby interpreter for Ruby.
  * [Ezra Zygmuntowic](http://www.brainspl.at/) is moving down to the Sacramento area in the next month or so, which will help build up the local community.
  * Using [Xen](http://www.xensource.com/) virtualization has worked really well for them.

I&#8217;m looking forward to the next meeting.
