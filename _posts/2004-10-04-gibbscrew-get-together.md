Lots of fun

Yesterday was a pretty great day. I got up and had brunch with Jon and Dopey who went on a banzai trip all the way from Vegas to spend the day. Joe, Ghen, Scum, Ben, and Tom showed up a little later. We hung out for the day doing mostly geeky things like playing BurnRate (the dotcom card game) and UNO Attack, which Kassie won, amazingly. We had dinner with the big group at Thai Basil in the back with the water and the open air. Of course everybody had to go home after downing some Chunky Monkey.
