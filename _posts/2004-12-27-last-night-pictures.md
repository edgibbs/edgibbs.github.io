I figured I haven&#8217;t posted many pictures of my adventure due to a number of factors. One being I didn&#8217;t have my digital camera with me. My backup option was an iSight video camera, which takes sort of blurry stills, and some effort to get the stills out. And then I was too tired to do all the work of adding images. So here are some sights of my cell:
