Whether by personality or just experience I&#8217;ve always leaned towards decision making by consensus. Most recently, I&#8217;ve been employing the consensus approach with 5 of our senior java developers working to define our development guidelines and practices. That means we don&#8217;t have some really exact list of standards, but where we do come to agreement the guideline is a lot more enforceable than one decided strictly by management or a single architect. Even worse an architecture consultant selected by management who never has to deal with the results of their mandated &#8216;best practices&#8217;. Anyway apparently I&#8217;m not alone as this is the [policy](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10296177/site/newsweek/) at Google:

> Strive to reach consensus. Modern corporate mythology has the unique decision maker as hero. We adhere to the view that the &#8220;many are smarter than the few,&#8221; and solicit a broad base of views before reaching any decision. At Google, the role of the manager is that of an aggregator of viewpoints, not the dictator of decisions. Building a consensus sometimes takes longer, but always produces a more committed team and better decisions

Probably explains why they have three major languages in C++, Python, and Java instead of insisting on a single one.
