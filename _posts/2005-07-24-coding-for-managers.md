I haven&#8217;t written a line of code in about a week at work. Sure I&#8217;ve reviewed some code, and made suggestions for developers, but I haven&#8217;t typed out any code in about a week now. It seems like management issues keep overwhelming any day to day coding or research. I&#8217;m beginning to feel like an &#8216;Enterprise Architect,&#8217; I just draw pretty UML diagrams and let the programmers implement my design. Danger! Danger! Will Robinson.

So this week things will change. I&#8217;m putting together a JUnit intro for our organization since many of them still don&#8217;t get the paradigm. And I&#8217;m coding in a half decent IDE, like IntelliJ, not just living in the ever so horrible PowerPoint IDE. &#8216;Code or Die&#8217; like the old skateboard video [game](http://www.vgmuseum.com/pics/skateordie.html) goes.
