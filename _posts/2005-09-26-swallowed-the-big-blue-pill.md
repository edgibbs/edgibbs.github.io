We&#8217;re running a training course on RAD 6.0, IBM&#8217;s Eclipse 3.0 based IDE. I still can&#8217;t bring myself to install it, but since we have to use it for some portal and BPEL functions we figured it made some sense to get some baseline training for the developers.

The trainer seems to be pretty good, but he&#8217;s worked for IBM for 10 years and he&#8217;s true blue. So someone in the class challenged him on when RAD was going to support Java 1.5. He replied that it already did. A few minutes later typing in a generic example in all red as unrecognized and he admitted defeat. Small trainer rule, **never say always**.
