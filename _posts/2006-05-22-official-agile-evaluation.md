This afternoon we held an update on our Agile pilot projects for much of the executive leadership of the company including the CEO. It was led by our agile coach and championed by our CIO.

At this point I&#8217;m not sure what to make of the results, but we still have a green light to go forward. The executives were pretty quiet overall which may have just been courtesy of a Monday afternoon meeting. What concerns were brought up centered around two basic items:

  * Co-Location
  * Dedicating staff

I&#8217;m not sure these are the major concerns in other places adopting Agile, but they have been ours. At the end of the day they both involve giving up some measure of control, and that is rarely an easy thing to do for a functional manager.
