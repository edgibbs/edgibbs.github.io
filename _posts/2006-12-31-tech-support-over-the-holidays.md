As with many techies I did some tech support for myself and relatives over the weekend:

  * Setup my in-laws backup solution to an external hard drive and did their first full backups. This took some time just because backing up about 200GB across two machines isn&#8217;t that fast.
  * Setup a wireless network for my in-laws. Super simple since they just bought an Airport Express at a garage sale. Plug it in, and do a reset and we&#8217;re done. Five minutes tops.
  * Finally upgraded from WordPress 1.5 to 2.0. Not much in the way of a difference, but at least I can feel a little more secure I&#8217;m not open to a host of security bugs.

At midnight I may celebrate by writing [Hello World](http://www2.latech.edu/~acm/helloworld/haskell.html) in Haskell.
