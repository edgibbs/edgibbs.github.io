I think the honeymoon phase for our official Agile projects is over with. The signs are:

  * On our first agile project the team got two facing rows of cubicles and a large team meeting room setup just for them.
  * On the second pilot the team got mostly moved into the same general wing of one building, but the QA person is separated by about 4 cubes from everyone else as well as the PM. And the business analyst is only dedicated 80% and is in another building. (Maybe the other 20% is dedicated to walking back and forth between buildings.)
  * The third Agile pilot is about to start and so far no one has been collocated. I&#8217;m working with an admin and the ScrumMaster to find some space, but no one&#8217;s volunteering. I&#8217;m a little more than tempted to suggest something radical like simply commandeering and squatting in a conference room for the next few months. We&#8217;ll have to see if our culture is really ready for that. I have volunteered my office for the team meeting room if they end up in our wing of the building.
