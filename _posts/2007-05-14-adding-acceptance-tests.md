Tomorrow we&#8217;ll demonstrate [Fitnesse](http://fitnesse.org/) tests for a complete 30 days of work to the whole team. We&#8217;ve piloted Fitnesse tests before for portions of a Sprint&#8217;s code, but never for an entire Sprint&#8217;s worth of work.

Our experience so far:

  * Some of the team is still having trouble understanding what Fitnesse is for. Responses have ranged from &#8220;OK, I think I get it,&#8221; to &#8220;We didn&#8217;t sign up for this.&#8221;
  * The developers have understood it best, but we&#8217;re championing automated acceptance tests.
  * QA has been easier to involve with writing tests, and they have helped add extra scenarios.
  * Business analysts are still taking a wait and see approach. They&#8217;re writing use cases for the first time. Fitnesse with its&#8217; wiki type approach is still an additional input they may not be quite ready for.

I&#8217;m hopeful we&#8217;ll turn some heads tomorrow at the review.
