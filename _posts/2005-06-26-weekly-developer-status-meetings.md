I don&#8217;t know how typical my status meetings are. I knew from attending numerous status meetings at past jobs what I didn&#8217;t like, long pointless reporting of status that everyone generally already knows. So here&#8217;s how mine go:

  * Scheduled for 30 minutes, but typically run 15 minutes.
  * Monday every week unless there&#8217;s a holiday in which case it&#8217;s not rescheduled.
  * A printed agenda handed out at the meeting, but not before.
  * Cover any management items that may affect the team from financials to consulting contracts. (My guess is I tend to cover more here than most care for)
  * Two or three items like training or upcoming projects.
  * Open up the end of the meeting for questions/comments. Usually this is short, but some weeks this takes up about 15 minutes, and it seems valuable even if it&#8217;s developers letting off steam about how insane it is to pay big money for the newest shiny tools and expect instant productivity improvements.
  * That&#8217;s it.
