Google Developer Day was a good experience for a free event. It&#8217;s always nice to see how software development shops go out of their way to make for happy developers. There were plenty of good snacks, bean bag chairs, reasonable wireless, a foosball table and pool table. I snagged two pretty nice T-shirts and they had enough for the 1500+ developers at the San Jose Convention Center. The lunch was the best I&#8217;ve ever had at a conference of any sort. I&#8217;m guessing we were getting the Google gourmet chef experience.

The talks ranged in value. Part of the issue is they were only 1 hour and generally not technical or tutorial style talks. There was really limited times for any questions. And note to any conference organizers&#8211;when you put a single mike in the room and it fills up it&#8217;s really hard for people to pick up their laptop and clamber through the crowd just to ask a question.

It was a Google developer day so the focus was on Google tools. GWT was my focus for the day to see if it&#8217;s a reasonable approach for some of our future web apps. As it stands I&#8217;m still taking the wait and see approach after attending a few of the talks. It has some weight behind it, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s really taken off as one of the defacto Java web frameworks yet. I&#8217;m pretty sure if we were leaving JSF, I&#8217;d probably favor Wicket or Struts 2 over GWT. They did have one really nice feature though. The back button actually works. Living in portlet and JSF land you often find that you don&#8217;t own the URL and supporting the back button can be nigh impossible.

Did I get enough out of it to attend next year? I&#8217;m still debating this. I&#8217;ll probably wait until next year and take a look at the agenda.
