After two days of ScrumMaster training with Ken Schwaber I&#8217;m now a certified ScrumMaster. The granting process also involves a secret handshake and greeting, which I&#8217;m not able to divulge here. The whole &#8216;certification&#8217; is sort of an inside joke since Scrum is a very lightweight set of project management practices. I did learn though that out of 3000+ certified ScrumMasters that one ScrumMaster has been officially stripped of their certification for completely failing to protect their team, so it is possible to really blow it and get decertified.

I have 30+ pages of scribbled notes now to review. I met lots of really motivated people which is really a nice environment to go through in a training class. Most classes have a certain percentage of people who just really don&#8217;t want to be there, and their presence just brings down the whole class. I&#8217;d recommend the experience or at least Ken&#8217;s version wholeheartedly as worth the investment.
