Websphere Portal Server is our current technology boat anchor. We&#8217;re stuck on Websphere Portal Server 5.1 until there&#8217;s a new release. Today we got the real picture on the release schedule from an IBM Portal Architect:

  * Portal Server 6.0 late summer
  * Portal Server 6.0.1.x maybe November 2006 (the stable one he recommended waiting for)
  * Portal Server 7.0 early 2007

So possibly this time next year we can finally move up to Java 1.5 after waiting about 2.5 years.
