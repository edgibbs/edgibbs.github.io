> I actually see people putting the cart before the horse. They want to go out and buy a registry. I&#8217;ve actually talked to a really large company. &#8220;We just bought a registry, we spent a lot of money.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Great how many services are you gonna put in that registry?&#8221; &#8220;Well we have three or four. And my point with those folks is, &#8220;You could keep up with that in an email or a wiki page. Why do you need a registry for three or four services.&#8221;

My point is if you don&#8217;t have services you can&#8217;t build out an SOA. Let alone governance to actually maintain, monitor, and manage the five services that you actually have.

I actually chuckled out loud on my way home.
