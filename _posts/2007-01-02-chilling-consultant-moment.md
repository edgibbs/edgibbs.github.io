You&#8217;re called in to help troubleshoot a problem. You get very little background. They worship you&#8217;re technical abilities and figure you can fix any problem in a few hours. The reality is they may have a problem you&#8217;ve never seen before and that you can&#8217;t fix in a few hours or maybe even a few days. 

Another reason I don&#8217;t miss the professional services world quite so much.
