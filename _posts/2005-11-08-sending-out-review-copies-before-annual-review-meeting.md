It&#8217;s annual review time around my organization again, so I&#8217;ve just sent out my review meeting notices and copies of my employee&#8217;s reviews. I prefer to send them out in advance so they&#8217;ve actually had a chance to read them before the meeting. Otherwise they spend the first few minutes scanning the review as fast as possible.

Sometimes though you have a review or two that isn&#8217;t likely to be that much fun to give and in that case I picked up this tip from Dick Grote:

> &#8220;If the person you&#8217;re appraising is a marginal performer with a bad rating, wait until the beginning of the meeting to hand over the appraisal. This increases your control of the situation.&#8221;
