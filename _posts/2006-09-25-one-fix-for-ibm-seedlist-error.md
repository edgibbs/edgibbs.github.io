One of our developers came across a strange fix to an error message we kept getting in Websphere Portal Search 5.1.0.3. The error message was along the lines:

<div class="codecolorer-container text vibrant overflow-off" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          Didn't find SeedList in HTML, not a SeedList URL
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

You might try adding a little known [property](http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24009954) to portal search:

<div class="codecolorer-container text vibrant overflow-off" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          HTTP_NON_APPL_MAX_BODY_SIZE_MB = 4
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

The parameter is supposed to set the maximum size of any page that it will search. It defaults to a measly 0.2MB. You would think that the portal server would just truncate anything longer, but maybe not. Anyway some badly designed HTML can climb over 200K pretty easily especially something generated by an application with lots of results. Speculation is that maybe large pages cause problems with the spider.

Anyway worth a try if you&#8217;re beating your head against the wall with this strange error. It worked in our shop even if it isn&#8217;t totally logical.
