Good business customers are a great resource. Today, at a Sprint review meeting, the product owner&#8217;s boss explained that she would really like another release planning exercise to determine when the team can deliver, but that she&#8217;s not holding anyone to a specific date. Then she followed up with something even better. 

Well it turns out we&#8217;re going to make the second part of the system a lot simpler. We thought we needed the ability to do audits based on maybe twelve answers to a question. Turns out we&#8217;re at about 99% within standards on all our tasks and we don&#8217;t really get much out of asking detailed questions in the application. So we decided just to ask if it got done on time, or it didn&#8217;t. Just binary options. **Therefore, there isn&#8217;t enough value in developing the more complex solution.**

They get it, they really get it! This is one of the best payoffs you get out of Scrum, Lean, Agile. When you:

  * make development transparent
  * get regular feedback
  * keep asking the question, &#8220;Does this provide real value?&#8221;

You can dramatically reduce waste.
