Doug Kaye of IT Conversations has proposed the idea of expanding IT Conversations into capturing [audio from presentations](http://www.rds.com/blogs/doug/index.php/archives/2005/07/01/the-new-business-model/) of all major IT conferences. Then the content might be released as a bundle for $50.00 or so as a new revenue stream for conferences. Since I can only afford the budget and time of perhaps one conference per year I think this is a great idea. I&#8217;ve been able to attend Web 99, Web 2001, and SD 2005 West over the past years and I&#8217;ve found these conferences really recharge my batteries. In fact even after attending SD 2005 about 4 months ago and pushing myself through it with a nasty case of shingles I got so many new ideas I&#8217;m still trying to figure out some ways to implement them.

The only problem I see with the model is the conference organizers have to agree. It might appear to them that if people can listen to the presentations later for a small fee, they might skip attending altogether. The other problem is finding enough volunteers to do the recordings, editing, and uploads. I&#8217;d volunteer here for any conference I attend once the details get worked out.
