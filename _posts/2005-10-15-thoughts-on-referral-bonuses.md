My personal thoughts on referral bonuses is that I prefer to avoid them. I&#8217;ve referred in probably four or five people on my own. Some of those companies paid referral bonuses, but I either split them with the candidate or just turned the whole thing over to them. Personally I only referred in someone if I had faith they were a good fit and the company was a good place to work. Considering I worked for at least one dotbomb I may have misestimated on that one, but I was up front about the risks.

As a manager now with an option to offer a referral bonus, I&#8217;ve turned avoided them. My theory is that if someone&#8217;s isn&#8217;t willing to recommend an acquaintance unless there&#8217;s a referral bonus, then they probably won&#8217;t make that great of an employee. Much of my bias against them stems from a past company where I saw referrals badly abused so that a few employees could make $10,000 or more referring in some dubious hires.

Given the number of resumes and interviews I had to go through for our last developer hire, I&#8217;m considering rethinking my approach to this. Since I&#8217;m going to be pretty thoroughly vetting everyone, maybe it&#8217;s worth seeing if adding a $3000-$5000 referral bonus. If we end up hiring without a referral again nothing&#8217;s really lost in the experiment. And if it ends up being a referral I make, I&#8217;ll try to convince HR to nix it since that&#8217;s just a bit unethical.
