Assumption was soon after installing the developer tools for Mac OS X 1.5 Leopard I&#8217;d have a brand new spanking copy of Java 1.6 on my MacBook Pro.

<pre>$ java -version
java version "1.5.0_13"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_13-b05-237)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_13-119, mixed mode, sharing)
</pre>

OK, surely it&#8217;s just defaulting there. Nope, no 1.6 version. No problem it&#8217;s supposed to be on the Apple Developer web site. I&#8217;ll just have to download it. Turns out there&#8217;s no mention of 1.6 at all. There&#8217;s the 64 bit support for 1.5 on Leopard, but no mention of 1.6. And there&#8217;s plenty of historical references to the Apple Developer site having downloads of Java 1.6 in the past, they&#8217;ve just pulled them all off the web site. 

OK, we&#8217;re still not using 1.5 at work yet, but it would be nice to run 1.6 at home.
