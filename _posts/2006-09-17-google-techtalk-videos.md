I&#8217;ve watched a [video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8135690990081075324&q=Google+engEDU) of Dave Astels on BDD at Google in the past, but [Kane Mar](http://kanemar.wordpress.com/2006/09/13/kens-presentation-at-google/) recently pointed out a [Google talk](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7230144396191025011) by Ken Schwaber on Scrum. Doing a search for [Google engEDU](http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=google+engEDU) reveals about 150+ talks. When I get some downtime I&#8217;m going to look through a few of them.
