[David Siegel](http://hs34.order-vault.net/~admin160/home.html) of Creating Killer Web Sites would be proud. Rands has composed an [entrance tunnel](http://managinghumans.com/) leading to the home page for his new book [Managing Humans](http://managinghumans.com/pitch.html). Rands terms it a &#8216;SLIDESHOW&#8217; but there&#8217;s no hiding an [entrance tunnel](http://www.waller.co.uk/flashpages.htm). I shed a tear remembering the last time I visited a site through an entrance tunnel back in the late 90s. 

I&#8217;ve already ordered the book.
