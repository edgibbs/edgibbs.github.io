Anesthesia Lightweight

I&#8217;m feeling much better now. My biopsy and portocath operation was actually two days ago, but as I remembered from last time I have a hard time recovering from the anesthesia. It was better than the last biopsy/removal of 4.5 years ago, but it still really knocks me out for 24 hours. I really don&#8217;t like brain altering chemicals in me.

So now a little portocath under my shoulder on my right side, that will probably be in for a few months. My little chemo/bone marrow transplant friend.
