I was cleaning out the closet today when I came across this cute little onesie from an old dotcom I worked for. I had my first daughter while working as a web development manager for XUMA. She never actually wore the onesie because it got packed up in a box for our move to Sacramento.

We were an e-commerce vendor doing a lot of projects on ATG Dynamo. There was an attempt to morph into a product company selling ASP services or in the new Web 2.0 world, Software as a Service. I&#8217;m glad the ASP model has finally become common place. If you need some functionality like a CRM, managed hosting, or security monitoring you usually a lot better off just utilizing an ASP option.
