On at least one of our Scrum projects the daily Scrums aren&#8217;t popular with the developers on the team. My best guess is that they need to adjust their format a bit. Typically the developers just read off the spreadsheet numbers on their tasks:

<div class="codecolorer-container text vibrant overflow-off" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          OK, I did 34 and 36, and take 2 hours off 37. &nbsp;Today, I'm working on the JSF page for feature X.
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

They were of the opinion that maybe they only needed one or two Scrums per week. My top of the head suggestion was maybe they needed to adjust how they ran the Scrums. Perhaps trying to focus more on just finished tasks and stop worrying so much about exact hours. The point of the Scrums are to sync up the team and share information, not feel like drudgery.
