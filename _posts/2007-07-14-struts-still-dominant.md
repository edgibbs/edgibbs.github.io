Struts is beating down the JSF challenge at least according to [the metrics](http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/how_popular_is_your_web)(comparing downloads can be a spotty exercise) Matt Raible comes up with for downloads:

  * Struts: ~340,000 per month
  * Spring: ~80,000 per month
  * Hibernate: ~80,000 per month
  * MyFaces: ~12,000 per month
  * Tapesty: ~12,000 per month
  * Wicket: ~10,000 per month

Comparing downloads can be a spotty exercise, but Matt summarizes:

> Sorry JSF, you appear to be losing. Badly.

I&#8217;m still scratching my head a little. I&#8221;m not raving fan of JSF, but anecdotal evidence that I&#8217;ve seen is that about 30-40% of the shops I hear about in our region are using JSF. JSF backlash is common, but since it&#8217;s part of the J2EE spec corporate shops just migrated over to it. JSF promises a shining component castle on the hill to corporate IT.

I&#8217;m favoring Wicket in the Java web frameworks, but we&#8217;re still a JSF shop in the office with some support for legacy classic Struts projects. The Ruby world is so easy, one major web framework.
