[Simon Baker](http://www.agileinaction.com/) has a very good example of a [team charter](http://www.think-box.co.uk/blog/2006/07/chartering.html) for an Agile project developed in Iteration Zero. It spells out how the team will do estimating, track progress, do TDD, implement continuous integration, and coding standards. This is the sort of example based template you can take and show your own team as a starting point. And apparently Simon also has very good whiteboard skills as evidenced by some of the pictures of his chartering mind maps.
