Apparently [GreenPepper&#8217;s Accept](http://www.greenpeppersoftware.com/site/website/home.page) launched at Agile 2006 as an acceptance testing framework built into a wiki. The idea is much like Fit/Fitnesse, with at least a few differences given that it&#8217;s based upon running in Confluence, and it has an open source version and a pay version. You can get a quick look at it in their demo [sandbox](http://www.greenpeppersoftware.com/accept/display/SBOX/Home#).

Right now they promise that:

> After using FIT for a while, we began to have ideas on how to extend its vision and reach. We looked at the code and we felt that doing a cleanroom implementation would be better.

I&#8217;m not sure what those ideas are right now, but it probably doesn&#8217;t hurt to have some more options in the acceptance testing tools space.
