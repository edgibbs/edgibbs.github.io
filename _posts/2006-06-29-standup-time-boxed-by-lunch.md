Typically daily Scrums are held as early in the morning as reasonable or later in the afternoon. Due to some strange circumstances the intranet portal project I&#8217;m Scrum Master on has a daily Scrum at **11:15**, right before lunch. At our retrospective early this week I asked if we should move it to another time or at least to say 11:00. The universal response was no, don&#8217;t move it.

The reasoning across the team was that by having it right before lunch it forced the meeting to fit into the 15 minute window and it cut down on the number of followup meetings held just after the Scrum. They liked having that added pressure to get the meeting done before running off to lunch. Strange, but it&#8217;s up the team to self-organize.
