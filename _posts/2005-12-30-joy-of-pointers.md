Joel Spolsky argues recently somewhat tongue in cheek that [Java just isn&#8217;t a good language](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html) to differentiate potential programmer candidates. At a high level I can agree with the sentiment that you want to know that someone knows more than Java.

On the idea of weeding people out I can&#8217;t say that his focus on understanding the ins and outs of pointers makes a whole heck of a lot of sense. Doing my undergrad at Georgia Tech in Physics many years ago my weed out courses were Differential Equations and Thermodynamics as I remember. I remember a time honored tradition at Tech was explaining to the incoming freshmen:

> Look to your right, now look to your left. By the time you graduate neither of those people will be there.

I remember thinking at the time that they were exaggerating. By the time I graduated 4 years later I realized they weren&#8217;t. 

Still with most candidates I look at the college they graduated from is a single line on the resume. Much more important is what they&#8217;ve actually done and whether they can actually describe it. A really great candidate would have a blog they could point me at and maybe an open source project or two that they had contributed to. I&#8217;m not sure that having them explain pointers means much to me, but I do typically ask a question about which language they&#8217;d prefer to use and why?
