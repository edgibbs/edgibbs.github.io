I&#8217;m into the second week of holding half hour one-on-one sessions with all of my folks. Today is my big day on Wednesday afternoon where I actually hold six one-on-ones from 1:00-4:00. At least half of the one-on-ones today began with the statement:

> &#8220;Hmm, I really don&#8217;t have anything to talk about this time, so I don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re going to talk about for half an hour.&#8221;

Every one of those one-on-one sessions today went the full 30 minutes and a few I had to cut off to make time for the next session. I distinctly remember this because my bladder was letting me know it could use a little restroom break, but from 1-4 today it was wall to wall one-on-ones.

This week felt a bit more laid back. People are starting to get adjusted to the style and I&#8217;m probably a bit more relaxed. So I&#8217;m beginning to see why I should have started these a long time ago.
