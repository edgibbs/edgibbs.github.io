For some reason our local java users group, [SACJUG](http://www.sacjug.org/), wandered onto a discussion of Rails. As is not unusual in the .NET/Java camps Ruby and Rails are none to popular for some reason. The three reasons that got discussed were:

  * Sure Ruby on Rails works for small apps, but when you&#8217;re talking about large applications with 20+ domain objects it just doesn&#8217;t work/scale.
  * RubyC is just way to slow, and who wants to scale with hardware.
  * The Active Record patter isn&#8217;t really an ORM layer, and it just doesn&#8217;t jive well with domain driven design.

Ignorance of course is bliss as almost no one had tried out Rails and only a few had seen some demos. For me I never see the point of getting really defensive about new options outside the core language I happen to get paid for currently. I think I might need to sign up for a short Rails demo so at least they can see how nice the productivity gains are. Maybe find a way to show a quick load test as well.
