I&#8217;ve run across a few developer podcasts worth listening to on my morning walks. [Drunk and Retired](http://www.drunkandretired.com) was a nice surprise. It has some low brow humor, cursing, and personal stories on non-software topics, but it manages to be a good back and forth between Charles and Cote. They&#8217;ve both been developers for 10 years or so. Charles is currently in Europe living the software developer&#8217;s version of the rock and roll lifestyle as an independent software developer, and Cote is recently married and working for a large corporate shop. 

The topics cover wide ranging current topics from Rails to Domain Specific Languages. Cote and Charles tend to be disparaging of most of these bleeding edge technologies, but their criticisms stem generally from hard experience or at least based on wild speculation. Give them a listen if you&#8217;re geeky enough to enjoy development podcasts.
