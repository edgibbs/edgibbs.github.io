I got around to downloading and running a Hello World example with Dave Winer&#8217;s [OPML editor](http://support.opml.org/) which has now been ported to the Mac. I like outliners in general, and there seems to be some promise this new outliner.

Anyway these are just first thoughts:

  * The OPML icon is ugly and pixilated, typical developer stuff.
  * The [directions](http://support.opml.org/download) assume there is only a Windows version after step 1. Instead of the saving the first document to <div class="codecolorer-container text vibrant overflow-off" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;">
      <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
        <tr>
          <td class="line-numbers">
            <div>
              1<br />
            </div>
          </td>
          
          <td>
            <div class="text codecolorer">
              C:\My Documents\OPML\www
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    
    it should go to
    
    <div class="codecolorer-container text vibrant overflow-off" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;">
      <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
        <tr>
          <td class="line-numbers">
            <div>
              1<br />
            </div>
          </td>
          
          <td>
            <div class="text codecolorer">
              /Users/edgibbs/OPML/www
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

  * After creating a test outline and looking at it in a browser, I&#8217;m not seeing any magic, but heh I only spent 10 minutes tops.

Now to look at the [Instant Outliner](http://support.opml.org/stories/storyReader$27) functionality. Dynamic outlines shared among a project team, interesting idea.
