Monday morning team meetings at 9:00am suck even more. Fortunately after ten weeks of 9am team meetings I&#8217;m moving my team meetings back to Tuesday at 10am.

For would be managers who are thinking about running team meetings on a Monday, my advice would be&#8211;don&#8217;t. A few reasons:

  * Most people don&#8217;t show up to work Monday morning bright eyed and bushy tailed. They will typically tune out much of what you&#8217;re saying.
  * I have to rush to prepare the agenda unless I was clever enough to put it together on Friday.
  * I haven&#8217;t had my weekly staff meeting with my boss so most corporate stuff will be at least a few days old.

My experience over the ten weeks was average attendance was maybe 75% instead of closer to 90%. Often this was because 9am is when about half of my staff typically shows up since they are dropping off kids at school and such. I got very few questions and people looked happy when the 30 minute meeting finished early. I often felt ill prepared because I had to rush my prep for the meeting. It just takes a little while to ease into the work week for most humans. 

Now that our 10 week security training is over I&#8217;m looking forward to a nice Tuesday staff meeting.
