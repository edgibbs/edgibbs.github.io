Developing on the Mac has generally been an awesome experience over the years especially with OS X and the UNIX underpinnings. The long pain point in this area is the lack of a solid supported package manager. It&#8217;s not in Apple&#8217;s DNA to worry about power users who actually use the terminal, and they&#8217;re unlikely to ever consider it important enough to delegate resources too. MacPorts and its hipster cousin Homebrew have been around for a while, but they&#8217;re always a bit rough around the edges, missing packages here and there, old versions, and sometimes they need extra tinkering just to install. In all it&#8217;s a most un-Mac like experience.

I don&#8217;t know that it will ever happen, but I know I&#8217;d support a Kickstarter that promised to maintain a Mac package manager like rpm or apt for OS X. I don&#8217;t care if they use Homebrew or Macports and just make it more robust, or build a new one from scratch. I&#8217;d just like a simple install of all those open source libraries. Yehuda Katz did a simple installer for [Ruby and Rails on OS X](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1397300529/railsapp) a few years back via a Kickstarter, so I know there&#8217;s precedent and this would impact a lot more developers. Saving hassle is certainly worth some bucks for a kickstarter.
