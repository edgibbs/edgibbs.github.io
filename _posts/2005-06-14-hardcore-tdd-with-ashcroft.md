Came across this little tool, [Ashcroft](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/ASH/Home) courtesy of ThoughtWorks, today to try to really enforce TDD. Helps to enforce some good practices, but I&#8217;m not sure I could live with the &#8220;dictatorial&#8221; approach. Probably a sign of my own weakness. I do love the concept of making sure the entire suite of unit tests only take a few seconds to execute.
