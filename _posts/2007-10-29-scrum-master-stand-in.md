A sign of team self-management success is when the Scrum Master is out or busy and someone just fills in. I&#8217;ve known one of our Scrum projects was moving along pretty well, but our organization still has a tendency to try to have another PM fill in at the daily standup. In the old command and control phase this made sense, but with a self-managing team it just becomes a minor impediment. Today I left a Scrum meeting with a big smile as one of the business analysts on the team had facilitated the standup.

Next step is having a rotating facilitator instead of always looking for the Scrum Master to lead.
