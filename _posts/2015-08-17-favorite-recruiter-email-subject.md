I just chuckled when the I got the following email from a recruiter:

### Are You Down With ATG???

Brilliant targeting as ATG barely survived the dotcom implosion and limped along before finally being sold off to Oracle. Given that almost any ATG developer would have been working in the late 90s, a reference to Naughty by Nature&#8217;s OPP was a great hook. Sadly I have zero interest in returning to work on a failed app server product, but I love the effort.
