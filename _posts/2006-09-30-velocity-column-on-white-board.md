[Simon Baker](http://www.agileinaction.com/) posted some pictures of his [tracking white board](http://www.think-box.co.uk/blog/2006/09/planning-board-and-user-story-cards.html). He actually has a velocity column on the far right end that occurs to me is a really good idea. Puts a visible focus on how much your actually able to accomplish for the Sprint instead of just the remaining hours for tasks.
