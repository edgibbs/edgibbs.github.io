I&#8217;ve been playing around with Ruby a bit as a break from things. Pulled down a nice Eclipse plug-in today, [Ruby Development Tools](http://rubyeclipse.sourceforge.net/). Basically covers everything but auto-completion and refactorings. OK, those are pretty big things, but it&#8217;s nicer than BBEdit and a [Ruby plugin](http://www.rubygarden.org/ruby?BbEdit).

I really like the fact that unit testing support is built into the base language.
