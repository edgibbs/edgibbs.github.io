It&#8217;s 3:30 on a Friday afternoon and you just got the test passing for a nasty intermittent bug after spending most of the day on it. Now you can jump back into the main code base and add that new feature. Only, that would be a bad idea.

The Friday Rule:

> Try to leave every Friday with a success.

You want to head into the weekend with a win. That win can be small, but carrying frustration into the weekend means you&#8217;re less effective next Monday. You walked away frustrated and probably thought about it over the weekend. Weekends are a critical for recharging batteries, spending time on hobbies, and hanging out with friends and families. They are not a good time to mull over bits of bad code or a misconfigured server. Walk out with a win.

There are some implications worth noting:

  * Say you fix the critical bug at 2:00PM on Friday. Switch your energies to something lighter like clearing your inbox, filling out release notes, updating the wiki, or completing a mandatory online training class.
  * If you&#8217;ve had a really long week already now is probably a good time to head home.
  * From a coding perspective leaving a good breaking point is to write one last test that fails. Then you can easily pick up where you left off.
  * As a manager when a developer swings by to explain how they finally got something working and you see it&#8217;s already well into Friday afternoon encourage them to take the victory with them over the weekend and not continue to code away.
  * This can apply as a daily rule, but it&#8217;s more critical on Friday where you can affect your mood for the whole weekend.
