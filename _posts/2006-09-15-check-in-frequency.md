Checking in to source control should be done early and often. I&#8217;ve taken this as a given since my first early days working in CVS. (I still working in CVS these days as it&#8217;s a good enough tool.) 

In a current project I got really busy with vendor meetings and other items during which time:

  * Over the course of a week I saw only an occasional check-in maybe once per day.
  * The check-ins were all by the same developer.
  * There were a total of zero check ins by the other three developers.

My preference is to check in at least every hour or so when working. The only rule is it has to still compile and the tests have to run. If I have to I&#8217;ll even comment out a broken test so I can do a successful checkin.

An opportunity for group feedback next week.
