After some debating I came across the much talked about book, [The Little Schemer](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/), at the Borders near Union Square in San Francisco. It compelled me to make a purchase and I&#8217;ve slowly started going through the examples. I really like technical books where you don&#8217;t actually have to be on a live computer to constantly try the exercises. And the cartoon elephants make me happy.

Next steps:

  * Install an xUnit in this case, [SchemeUnit](http://planet.plt-scheme.org/display.ss?package=schemeunit.plt&owner=schematics)
  * Install a text editor/IDE looks like [DrScheme](http://www.plt-scheme.org/software/drscheme/). (Even OS X screen shots)
