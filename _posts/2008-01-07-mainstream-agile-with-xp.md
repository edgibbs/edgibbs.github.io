I hadn&#8217;t realized the Head First series now has a book on [software development](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596527358/). Curious, I took a glance at the table of contents. Topics include:

  * TDD
  * User Stories
  * Burn Down Charts
  * Continuous Integration
  * Test Coverage

Agile and XP practices are starting to be assumed. Maybe Ambler and others are right that Agile has really crossed the chasm. Just a year or so ago I bemoaned the [lack of unit testing examples](http://edgibbs.com/2007/01/27/head-first-java-2nd-edition-tdd/) in [Head First Java 2nd Edition](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hfjava2/) where they went with the lame old **main()** method to demonstrate code. Now we have whole chapters devoted to TDD.

If you can&#8217;t honestly put unit testing or continuous integration on your resume you might want to stop sitting on the sidelines and get up to speed.
