Recently ran across a [blog entry](http://jroller.com/trackback/roblambert/Weblog/does_anyone_use_jsf) where [Rob Lambert](http://jroller.com/page/roblambert) asked if anyone was actually using JSF? My initial experience is I don&#8217;t know anyone using it for any real project. Struts is pretty common, I occasionally here about something like Velocity, but never JSF. 

I remember looking into local training classes when I thought JSF might be viable in our area around Sacramento. Turned out there was only one class available in the last 9 months and it got canceled. I walked through 300+ pages of JSF in Action, but I got frustrated that it was too front end focused, and it had some nasty javascript it implemented for simple things like links that caused turmoil for using JWebUnit on it. In the end we went with Struts. I&#8217;m thinking JSF may very likely die on the vine.
