Sometimes technical folks selling enterprise software can be so very honest. We had an IBM architect, of which they have many, mention in a presentation on SOA admit:

> &#8220;This is not easy stuff to implement. You got a Ferrari but it came in boxes and pieces.&#8221;

I don&#8217;t know if we got a Ferrari. Considering we bought the Websphere solution based on feeling safer with a large application platform vendor versus going with a best of breed type solution, I doubt it will ever turn into a Ferrari. I&#8217;d settle for a Ford Taurus that actually did something out of the box.

And the bit about not being easy to implement, no kidding. As software development is swinging towards greater simplicity with open source frameworks, dynamic languages making a comeback, and even J2EE slimming down with EJB 3.0, enterprise vendors are still pushing complexity.
