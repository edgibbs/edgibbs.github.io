Reviewing resumes as a manager, tech lead, or even just a developer is no one&#8217;s favorite activity. Resume&#8217;s are inefficient, misleading and so often **boring**. If you&#8217;re a prospective hire boring is bad.

A simple case is the standard corporate style J2EE developer resume. There are host of bullet points claiming skills I already expect them to have with 10+ years of development experience.

  * Spring
  * Hibernate
  * Tomcat, JBoss, Weblogic, or WebSphere
  * A smattering of design patterns from Singleton to Template Method
  * Javascript and some JQuery
  * Some selection of Java&#8217;s innumerable web frameworks.
  * Oracle/SQL Server/MySQL

At this point they&#8217;ve done nothing to distinguish themselves from the pile of already screened and rejected resumes beside them. You&#8217;ve developed on the JVM for 10+ years and you&#8217;ve never looked into alternative JVM languages. No Groovy, Scala, or Clojure. Not even some adventure off the JVM into Ruby, Go, Elixir, Python.

Java is by design a simple if verbose language with a huge amount of libraries and IDE tooling. It has never been the best solution for almost anything. Luckily there&#8217;s been a &#8220;Get out of Jail&#8221; free card option for a long time now. You can pull out a JVM language that better fits the problem space solve the problem more elegantly. All that and still produce compatible byte code and interop easily with existing Java libraries. It&#8217;s a career limiting to ignore that opportunity.

For the brave there&#8217;s always the option of leaving the JVM entirely and trying something like Ruby, Python or Go. It may require adjusting to life outside a familiar IDE or dealing with a new set of libraries, but it&#8217;s not a very difficult step to make.

So fair or not let me explain the conclusions I make when I see a J2EE developer resume with many years of experience and no mention of a second or third language experience:

  * Not very interested in learning in an engineering field that is constantly changing.
  * Did the majority of their learning by working on an existing Java codebase, and aren&#8217;t interested in spending any time coming up to speed on anything that isn&#8217;t currently required for the job.
  * Don&#8217;t enjoy development as a pursuit other than the fact that it&#8217;s fairly well compensated.
  * Are OK with doing things the hard way because they have one hammer in the toolbox.
  * Think they know a second language because they hack some javascript when required.
  * Copy and Paste is their most common approach to gaining code refuse.
  * Won&#8217;t be able to come up to speed quickly.
  * Are going to bomb out in a phone screen, so no point in scheduling one.
