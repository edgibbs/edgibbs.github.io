Rails is just darn nice for making easy to test. I finally got around to trying out the [autotest](http://nubyonrails.topfunky.com/articles/2006/04/19/autotest-rails) package (via a mention by[Luke Melia](http://www.lukemelia.com/devblog/archives/2006/06/19/autotest-rails/)) and now I&#8217;m just churning away TDD style while the tests run in a terminal window, without stopping to do any invocation or even a keystroke.
