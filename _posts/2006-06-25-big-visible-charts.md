James Shore has a post on [Informative Workspaces](http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/informative_workspace.html). He suggests using hand drawn charts and having everyone on the team update them where possible. Some of his ideas for charts include:

  * A chart showing pairing time.
  * A chart showing pairing combinations.
  * A team calendar.
  * A code coverage chart.
  * A chart of tests executed per second.
  * A chart of the lines of code in the system.
  * A chart of the age of the oldest open support request.
  * A chart of non-story work.
  * A chart of unavailable customer guesses.
  * A chart of customer and programer interactions.

We have yet to do any serious experimentation with pairing yet, so we haven&#8217;t used charts for that. We have used charts for the team calendar and code coverage. We&#8217;ve also used charts for number of unit tests and to track tasks. Reading this post gave me the idea that I need to try doing a hand-drawn chart of our code coverage. I tend to use a stock Clover print-out and I only occassionally change it. I really like the idea of the team owning the chart and updating as well. This does happen with the calendar and the task board, but I think it could be useful for some of these other charts.
