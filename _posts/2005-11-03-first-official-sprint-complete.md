Our first official Scrum project finished it&#8217;s first Sprint successfully today. I&#8217;m a bit jealous since they have institutional support, while I&#8217;ve run multiple Scrum style projects without buy-in from the business. In fact our PM group has officially explained to us that we can&#8217;t use Agile methodologies. 

We&#8217;ve adopted the bulk of the practices such as daily standups, 30 day iterations, planning meetings, project retrospectives, and a product backlog. Still we&#8217;re stuck in a traditional waterfall process for the overall project, so everything moves slower and we have to wait a lot because we&#8217;re the only ones running a 30 day Sprint.

Our culture is still very much waterfall oriented. We&#8217;re backing out code on a project right now because our process only allows features that are fully documented to be added even when the customer wants them. We&#8217;re so set in our process that just removing access to the new features isn&#8217;t good enough. We have to remove all the actual code to comply with our process. If we don&#8217;t our QA team won&#8217;t test the application at all.

It&#8217;ll be a nice change when Agile/Scrum becomes the default practice instead of only being officially allowed on pilot projects.
