I came across an idea I&#8217;m kicking around adopting in [Alistair Cockburn&#8217;s](http://alistair.cockburn.us/) [Crystal Clear](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201699478/ref=ase_alistaircockburn/104-9123233-7993537?v=glance&s=books). The idea is that to help move forward the professionalism of your group you hold a weekly meeting to discuss a chapter of an important software title such as Kent Beck&#8217;s <u>Test Driven Development</u> or Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas&#8217;s <u>Pragmatic Programmer</u>. The more I think about it, the more I like it. I&#8217;ll probably try out the idea on my team with Kent Beck&#8217;s <u>Test Driven Development</u> since that&#8217;s the area we&#8217;re lacking the most currently. I figure if I serve milk and cookies I can get over the Oprah&#8217;s book club fears.
