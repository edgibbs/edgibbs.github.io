Hair is gone, nasaeau is longer lasting

Well, my hair is long gone now, except for some spotty bristle patches that are falling out when I rub them. The hospital stay this time was extra long, I didn&#8217;t get out until 1:00pm on Friday because they took 36 hours to give me the 24 hour chemo drug. I have my first mouth sore as well.

That said I&#8217;m feeling pretty good this week. I&#8217;ve been back at work, I had a PET scan that I expect to come back clean. Only one more RICE cycle and then on to the great stem cell transplant.
