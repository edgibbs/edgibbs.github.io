I ran through a seminar with 7 of my developers today covering JUnit and TDD. Overall I think it went pretty well. I overestimated the material and labs we could get through, and I ended up dumping two labs out of five. Still they got a real hands on experience and I still managed to run through Bob Martin&#8217;s [Bowling Game Kata](http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata).

I snuck in a good bit of pair programming. We had to run the class on our own laptops with only a few to go around, thus all but one of the developers were paired up. As usual I overheard some good conversations debating the best approaches. The one solo developer shot through the labs faster than any of the pairs, but I&#8217;m just going to chalk that up to his skill level.

I think by the end of the [Bowling Game Kata](http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata) that a lot of them really got it. Over the next few months we&#8217;ll see how well this strategy worked. Next I get to spread the wealth to the rest of our java developers, and lucky for them I&#8217;ve worked out some of the kinks in the class with my first group. 

The number one request for a follow-up class focused on approaches for testing databases and GUIs.
