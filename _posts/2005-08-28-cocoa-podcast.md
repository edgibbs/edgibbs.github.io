Apparently my assumption that there will eventually be a podcast for every niche is starting to happen. [Cocoa Radio](http://www.cocoaradio.com/) is an entertaining podcast devoted to independent Mac software developers developing in Cocoa. So far there&#8217;s only a few out there, but the focus is on interviews with independent Mac developers like [Brent Simmons](http://ranchero.com/) of NetNewsWire fame. Not sure it&#8217;s enough to inspire me to pick up a book on Objective C, but heh, you never know.
