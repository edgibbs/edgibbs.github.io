I&#8217;ve noticed that on some of our Scrum projects we sometimes have a gap of a few days between starting the next Sprint. Often this is because getting time arranged to meet with the customer can&#8217;t be done on the day after the Sprint ends necessarily.

I think we&#8217;d be better off if we could start the next Sprint right away, but given the fact that the business side of our organization and our PMs haven&#8217;t really embraced the idea beyond the official pilot it appears to be something we&#8217;ll have to accept. At the end of the day we&#8217;re delivering on the Sprints and that&#8217;s the critical part.
