Over the past several years my blog has followed the path of many others gradually following into an irregular posting schedule until there were no more than a few posts per year. I always felt guilty, but not enough to really put true effort into restarting it. I came across a pots on [SimpleProgrammer.com](http://simpleprogrammer.com) offering a short [email driven program](http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/) to startup/restart a blog and I went ahead and signed up. Sometimes a bit of external pressure is just enough to restart a habit. So this is the third new post in the last 2 weeks, and I&#8217;m attempting to post every Monday now. Can&#8217;t complain that it hasn&#8217;t worked so far and feel free to blast me if I start falling short.
