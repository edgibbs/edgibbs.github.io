It&#8217;s nice to know a big name consultant like [Rick Hightower](http://jroller.com/page/RickHigh) is [struggling mightily](http://jroller.com/page/RickHigh?entry=lighter_faster_yada_yada_yada) with Websphere Portal and RAD 6 as well:

> The loading process is a 15 page document of push this button, push that button, install this, stand on your head, fill out this dialog, sacrifice a goat, scroll this list, repeat, repeat, walk around your cube backwards seven times while chanting SOA.

The scary part here is we&#8217;re wondering about how we automate anything with the horrible wizard based deployment. Hopefully there&#8217;s a well documented work around. 

Then Rick runs into the same solution we hear from our IBM Websphere Partner certified consultants. &#8220;Well we can file a trouble ticket with IBM.&#8221; Basically an admission of defeat.

> I am told we can put in a ticket wtih IBM, which will take about a month to resolve.

And of course resolving some of these means the IBM helpdesk person just closes it as resolved without ever fixing anything. The joy is you pay a lot of money for all of this.
