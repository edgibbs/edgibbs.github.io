Gutsy Fight

I just finished reading the cancer blog of [Emma Candy](http://mayibefrank.typepad.com), a 35 year old woman in England battling cancer. I recognize the sarcastic humor in her posts and her focus on the future, from my first bout with the disease. It helps to remind me how I&#8217;m facing the current possible relapse. If I end up having to do chemo again, I am so going to Disneyland real soon.

On a lighter note, I went to West&#8217;s birthday today. He&#8217;s four and one of the many C street kids. I spent about 30 minutes in a Blue&#8217;s Clues bounce house which Kassie just loved me for. I dropped my parents at the airport as well. Mom&#8217;s planning a celebration when this turns out to be a branchial cleft cyst.

Oh, the picture from the previous day&#8217;s post was sort of random. It&#8217;s from a overlook of a beach near Del Mar in San Diego where Kassie and I played while Micki was feeding Molly just before we made it to the beach this year.
