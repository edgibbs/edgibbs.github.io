I know I&#8217;m in trouble when the developers all start explaining how they skipped out of a two day training session after the lunch break on the first day. Once again they volunteered to attend a training session that was a lot more &#8220;death by powerpoint&#8221; then a true training session.

I often refer to these kind of situations as random training. It&#8217;s such a common anti-pattern that when you see these developers in vendor classes they explain in their introduction to the class that they&#8217;re not sure why they&#8217;re here since they&#8217;ve coded Oracle Forms all their life and they&#8217;ve never coded in Java before. What&#8217;s happened is their manager probably had one of the following thoughts:

  * There&#8217;s a training plan in my employee&#8217;s goals for this year so this will let me check off that box.
  * We had training credits we need to **burn**.
  * I heard Oracle is moving to Java and so our DBAs need to get up to speed.
  * We have a pilot java project starting in 6 months, so I&#8217;ll send Sue to get her ready now.
  * We brought in a custom course on site and we need to pack it with any IT employees to fill up the class and really get our money&#8217;s worth.
  * After a week of classroom training our junior developers will be ready to leap into cutting edge development on our new technology.
  * I know Sue wanted to go to an industry conference, but that costs travel money and this class was local and on a big discount.

My personal philosophy is management should try to provide at least a week of classroom training or a week at a high end conference per year. That and buy stacks of technical books for anyone willing to train up on a new area.
