In a meeting today with a lot of IBM Websphere product architects they didn&#8217;t quite come to the conclusion that UDDI was dead, but they did say that at this point UDDI is an important spec, but it&#8217;s just not meeting the needs of people trying to roll out SOA architectures.

IBM&#8217;s thoughts around this assume that everyone is coming to the same conclusion that UDDI just doesn&#8217;t do enough so they&#8217;re creating more functional replacements. The replacement is called Websphere Service Registry and Repository Capability at this point. I&#8217;m not sure whether there are more WS* specs or Websphere branded products in the world.

At this point they didn&#8217;t have a whole lot of details around there product in particular, but they were willing to speculate on where UDDI is going. There idea is that a few proprietary approaches are being developed by vendors and then a spec process will happen after some experimentation and everyone can essentially agree on the UDDI replacement or UDDI 2.0.

They didn&#8217;t really seem too out in left field on this as our company architect has been telling me UDDI is pretty much dead on arrival for a while now. In addition at a Bird of a Feather session on SOA at SD West 2006 I asked how many of the 50 participants were using UDDI. One brave soul raised his hand from the State of Oregon. He said they did have a UDDI registry setup and a few web services registered with it. He then explained that everyone using their web services had hard coded them without using the UDDI registry at all.
