One of the most heartening things developers at our shop have done is start a sort of technical book club. About a year ago one developer got really into patterns and suggested running some sessions around a particular pattern. It branched out later to two developers and now every two or three weeks one of them runs a session on a pattern for an hour or two. 

The format has morphed a few times, but overall it&#8217;s a really good sign that as a development organization we&#8217;re still looking to improve. And the best part is I had no part in the idea. All I did was agree to order about a dozen copies of [Head First Design Patterns](http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2005/04/06/designpatterns.html). Soon they&#8217;re going to swap out and do chapters of [Effective Java](http://java.sun.com/docs/books/effective/), so I&#8217;ll be ordering some new books.
