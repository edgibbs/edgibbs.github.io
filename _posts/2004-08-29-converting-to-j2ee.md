From web development scripting languages to the current leading object oriented language

I&#8217;m embarking down the road of a challenge I&#8217;ve been seeking for some time. I get to move a large web development team with a background in client server, mainframe, and coldfusion into the java world. To add to the migration I get to teach them, iterative agile methodology, test driven development, and a host of open source tools from ant to cruise control. Despite the challenges I think I can actually pull it off. Now I just have to start to develop course materials and mentoring. Six of them underwent Intro to Java just last week. Look for more entries related to simple initial projects here.
