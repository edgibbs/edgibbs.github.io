About a week ago I signed up with our local [Java Users Group](http://www.sacjug.org/) to do a talk on [Fitnesse](http://www.fitnesse.org/), since they hadn&#8217;t been able to line up any speakers. The talk went fairly well and there were quite a few questions which is always a good sign. It did force me to bone up on my Fitnesse knowledge.

The community seems to be getting more sophisticated at least locally. In the open discussion things like AspectJ and profiling code came up. One nice thing was that many of the audience actually had some unit testing exposure. Many of them weren&#8217;t doing hardcore TDD, but trying to move in that direction. All told it&#8217;s a nice sign that unit testing adoption is picking up in the general java community.
