Approximately two weeks after coming up with a [new layout](http://edgibbs.com/2006/07/08/office-to-team-room/) to swap my office into a team room I now have the following:

The vision was to pull out all the cabinets and mount another large whiteboard on the west wall and bring in a couch. This mainly just turns the focus of the room from an office into a meeting room while leaving the space eating cabinets, but it&#8217;s 70% of the vision and they only had to remove one desk panel.
