Reading through Scott Ambler&#8217;s recent results of his Agile [survey](http://www.ddj.com/dept/architect/191800169?pgno=3) it stood out that one of the least used practices was colocation. Common coding conventions were almost 4 times as popular and even pair programming is more popular than colocation. Fighting the facilities battle is still a losing battle many places.
