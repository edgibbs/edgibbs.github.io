I had a lingering issue resolving connection to an outside VPN and getting into a CVS repository for weeks. I&#8217;ve been on and off trying to get it resolved between typical management tasks. Today I mentioned it as an impediment in Scrum where I&#8217;ve volunteered to do some coding. By 1:30 in the afternoon the problem had been solved. Sign of a Scrum Master on the ball.
