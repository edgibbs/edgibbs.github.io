I came across a [post](http://www.redsquirrel.com/blog/archives/00000170.html) by [Dave Hoover](http://redsquirrel.com/dave/) explaining a technique he called [Ping Pong Programming](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PairProgrammingPingPongPattern). 

  * Developer A writes a new test and gets a red bar.
  * Developer B implements the code to get to a green bar.
  * Developer B writes the next test.
  * Developer A implements it.

And of course you&#8217;re allowed to refactor where ever reasonable. I hadn&#8217;t thought about this in respect to pairing up with my developers as I try to get them hooked on TDD, but it seems a very good pattern for learning how the process works. And of course it becomes sort of a fun competitive game.
