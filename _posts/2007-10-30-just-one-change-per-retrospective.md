A core part of Scrum and many other Agile methodologies is &#8216;inspect and adapt.&#8217; Retrospectives are a key practice in reviewing the last iteration. You toss up on stickies or a white board the &#8216;What Went Well&#8217; and &#8216;What To Look Into.&#8217; 

[Diana Larsen](http://www.futureworksconsulting.com/blog/) held a session at the end of [Agile Open California](http://www.agileopencalifornia.com/) on retrospectives and suggested two key ideas on how to take action after a retrospective:

  * Pick one or at most two things on the list to work on for the next iteration.
  * Only pick something that at least one person in the room has the energy to take on. If no one has the energy for the next iteration don&#8217;t try to force change.
