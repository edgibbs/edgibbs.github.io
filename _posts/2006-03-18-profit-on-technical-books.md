> &#8220;If you like this presentation, feel free to buy one of my books, they have them up at the bookstore. Or you can just give me five dollars, I&#8217;ll make more money that way.&#8221;

So in case you didn&#8217;t already know, writing a technical book isn&#8217;t a venture you undertake for profit. I have heard that the average technical book has a press run of about 3000 and that authors end up seeing very little after all the costs are taken into account. Does make you appreciate the effort people will undertake to share knowledge.
