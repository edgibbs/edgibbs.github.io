You figure with a collocated team information will flow freely. It does to some extent, but things can still get missed. On many Sprints one of the key safety mechanisms are the daily standups.

A typical hypothetical example might be a developer reporting an impediment about how they had spent half the day trying to implement a PDF report. The developer had been working solo, just heads down at the keyboard. Within seconds of mentioning this at the standup, a tester would point out he thought the report was just going to be a web page and soon an analyst might bring up an old discussion were the business decided they just wanted an online screen for the report, they really didn&#8217;t need to print it, and especially not as a PDF. Impediment solved.

The lesson here is:

  * A good standup where people quickly describe their commitments, what they worked on and impediments can catch problems early. This is very much in the line of the lean idea of &#8216;stopping the line&#8217;.
  * If your standups consist of team members stating, well I finished #37 and I&#8217;ll be working on #102 today you&#8217;re missing critical information.
  * Many practices reinforce the idea of capturing issues or opportunities early and often.

  * Automated unit tests to capture issues as they&#8217;re being coded.
  * Continuous builds to catch integration problems.
  * Collocated teams so that people overhear important conversations or get consulted on decisions because they&#8217;re right there when something comes up.
  * Daily standups to allow for at least a daily sync up.
  * Sprint reviews to bring stakeholders in to see what&#8217;s being delivered.

Instead of having wrong assumptions slip through they can be corrected within 8 hours. And that&#8217;s less hours of wasted work. Not a bad investment for a 15 minute meeting.
