Today our [Agile Lite](http://edgibbs.com/2006/07/21/agile-lite/) project was officially voted in as an Agile project. Proof that persistence pays off after about 6 months. The project has always been a Scrum project minus colocation, and we were always forced to pretend it wasn&#8217;t an &#8216;official&#8217; Agile project. In this case official refers to getting the blessing from the PMO.

Semantics aside I think we&#8217;re getting closer in our organization to assuming Agile/Scrum as the default methodology unless there&#8217;s some overriding reason to do things differently. That&#8217;s some progress.
