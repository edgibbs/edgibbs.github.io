I had two major practices to put in place to improve our overall software development for this fiscal year. 

  1. Implementing Test Driven Development with a target of 70% unit test coverage.
  2. Implementing frequent, lightweight code reviews.

Easy enough, on number two we&#8217;ve been fairly successful and will continue to tighten things up over the next year. [Crucible](http://www.cenqua.com/crucible/) has proved to be a good lightweight tool to help enable this.

On number one I suspect we&#8217;re at the same place a lot of development shops end up especially if they aren&#8217;t already XP shops. We&#8217;re doing a bit of TDD, but the bulk of the unit tests are written after the code sometimes days or weeks after the code. Thus we lose a lot of the design benefit. As a bonus it feels more like a chore when you write the tests later.

On a positive note, we&#8217;ve come a long way and the developers see many of the benefits of having a good set of tests around your code. And all pretty much all of the code developed this year had 70% or greater test coverage.

Next year is likely to see another goal of going from unit testing to TDD.
