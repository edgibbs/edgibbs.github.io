Don&#8217;t give up.

During my first battle with cancer, I remember visiting the XUMA offices in San Francisco when one of the project managers David something pulled me aside. He told me an emotional story of his father who had also fought and lost a battle with cancer. His overridding concern was that I fight the thing, since his father had really given up and then just succumbed. Probably exactly the sort of memories I need right now. I&#8217;m ready to fight tooth and nail right now, I&#8217;m just a little unsettled about not having the particulars figured out.

And tomorrow we explain cancer to our 4 year old.
