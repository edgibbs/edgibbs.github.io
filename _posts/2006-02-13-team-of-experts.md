Common advice with managing experts is to relax and just get out of their way. Therefore Scrum and any Agile methodology naturally accentuate this strategy. They&#8217;re designed to cut the process down to a minimal level and let the team self-organize. Then the real world steps in.

Try putting together an expert team. Sure you may have a few experts on a team, but unless it&#8217;s a really high profile project, you can&#8217;t pull all the best experts at your company and staff them on the same project.

So you sub-optimize. You get maybe a really good PM/ScrumMaster and a really experienced tech lead. You have a few less senior people on the team who are going to need some help with learning curves. Maybe you have almost all senior developers on a project, but you ask them to work with a completely new toolset/language/framework where they&#8217;re not experts.

Sub-optimal Scrum is still a lot better than the typical waterfall. At least the nasty learning curve or other difficulties are taken on as a team and built into estimates and adjusted as you go. And if you want to put a whole team of novices on something then you&#8217;re bound to fail no matter what you do.

The second quote from one of our sysadmins should probably be better explained. Their experience was with a &#8216;Scrum&#8217; project that was pretty much Scrum in name only. The standups regularly went 30+ minutes, there were effectively two ScrumMasters and two product owners. You can get in way over your head on a project using pretty much any methodology.
