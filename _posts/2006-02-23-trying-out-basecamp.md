I signed up for a free one project account for [Basecamp](http://www.basecamphq.com/) today and setup a small project for my company&#8217;s core values committee. So far it seems really nice, easy collaboration with a small team. The real test will come over the next few weeks if it actually gets used. I love these sorts of things, but I don&#8217;t pretend that everyone gets into them. We may end up doing a lot of coordinating via email if the team isn&#8217;t ready for web collaboration.
