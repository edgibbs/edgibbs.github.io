I launched a [Basecamp](http://www.basecamphq.com/) project today. Nothing fancy, just a little project site for our company&#8217;s core values committee. Yes, we fall into the Ken Blanchard [Managing by Values](http://www.refresher.com/!values.html) type corporation or at least we&#8217;re trying. Anyway I&#8217;m a sucker for trying to make things better over just complaining and besides the theme this year for our annual employee offsite was Teamwork.

So far the coolest feature is that [Basecamp](http://www.basecamphq.com/) lists the people on the project by the last time they logged in so you can get a sense in real time if people are actually using it. They just tuck it away in the right column after you log in, but I really enjoy that feature. Anyway these things often end up not being used so much so we&#8217;ll see how this goes. Since the majority of the committee aren&#8217;t IT folks, I&#8217;ll be giving a 10 minute demo on how to use it. Seems a bit odd, but then I spend a lot of time using various web applications so much of it is second nature to me.

Anyway it&#8217;s free for a single project, so it&#8217;s a great way to try it out.
