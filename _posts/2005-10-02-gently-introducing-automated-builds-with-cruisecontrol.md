My team has been running automated builds pretty for well over a year now on at least one project, but the bulk of our projects weren&#8217;t being built on any regular basis. I&#8217;ve been gently introducing the concept and adding all our current projects to the build cycle. This is the week where we jump in fully. Tomorrow I have a short Keynote presentation to the team explaining cruisecontrol and how it works on our little build box. The message is essentially faster feedback and faster failures is a better way to build software. I&#8217;m interested to see the feedback I get tomorrow when I present this at the weekly staff meeting.
