Yes, Scrum does have a secret handshake, you can find out about it if you take one of the CSM courses. It&#8217;s a little bit of fun nothing all that serious. It also involves &#8216;woofing&#8217; like a sheepdog. Apparently it&#8217;s ruffled the feathers of some &#8216;serious&#8217; Agile practitioners, to the tune of 30+ messages on the Scrum Yahoo group. After seeing some of the debate Ken posted his thoughts:

> You know, I think I&rsquo;m really glad that I added something light such as a secret, encrypted handshake. It really seems to be a good way of weeding out people who don&rsquo;t have a sense of humor and are, maybe, too serious about everything. Or, maybe, I expect too much from CSM&rsquo;s. I think that the work we are undertaking is so serious and so hard that any way that we can inject levity is well worth the effort. I always thought that &ldquo;woof&rdquo; created some sense of camaraderie, but maybe I&rsquo;m wrong.

If you&#8217;re not having fun at work, at least some of the time, it&#8217;s time to find a new job. It&#8217;s an &#8216;Agile&#8217; lightweight process not a high ceremony, formal, always serious process.
