Turns out the first developer in our organization to actually bring in Rails and use it for something real is a Unix sysadmin. He needed to transform a spreadsheet of inventory into a little web based system and he had heard some stuff about Ruby on Rails and wanted to try it out. 8 hours later he had popped out his first app to replace a spreadsheet. And this is coming cold from no background in Ruby. He&#8217;s pretty jazzed about how nice and productive it is for web applications.
