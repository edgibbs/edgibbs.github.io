In the tradition of code smells here&#8217;s some Enterprise Tool Smells:

  * Install time is measured in days.
  * Installation involves cryptic steps such as after step 17c, delete these files, then restart the installation script.
  * The install software doesn&#8217;t fit on a single DVD, necessitating baby-sitting it so you can dump the next CD/DVD when it&#8217;s ready.
  * Tool promises that regular business people can use it and write business rules in a &#8220;natural language,&#8221; making code monkey&#8217;s irrelevant.
  * It has an Enterprise version that installs tons of features, servers, plug-ins, that no one ever uses.
  * It uses lots of wizards.
  * Company recommends hiring consultants to train you in how to use the tool.
  * Despite features like &#8220;seamless hot deploy&#8221;, any change involves rebooting the server.
  * Restarting the service or tool is measured in minutes not seconds.
  * No one including the sales team can really explain the licensing terms for all the different purchase options.
  * Productivity takes a radical nosedive when tool is introduced, and then mysteriously increases sometime later when employees stop using the tool.
  * Support involves filing trouble tickets or issues that are never resolved though sometimes promised to be in the next release.
  * It&#8217;s in the Gartner magic quadrant.
