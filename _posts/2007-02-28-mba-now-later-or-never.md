[Dina](http://www.controllingchaos.com/?page_id=15), one of the creators of the project management podcast [Controlling Chaos](http://www.controllingchaos.com/), is heading back to MBA school at age 42. Better yet, she&#8217;s planning on attending [UC Davis MBA School](http://www.gsm.ucdavis.edu/) which is currently the best available option in the Sacramento region. And best yet, she&#8217;s [blogging](http://mbachaos.wordpress.com/) the experience.

Her decision to go for it came down to:

> I really like being a project manager and the company I work for is a super place to work. But I&rsquo;m at the top of the pay scale and top position for a project manager. There is no where else for me to go unless I want to move into a functional manager role. Upward mobility and taking on more responsibilities, decision making authority, being a part of driving the strategic direction of a company, and yes, more salary is very important to me. Not going to happen in my current position.

I&#8217;m rooting for her to get a good GMAT score for selfish reasons, to see what MBA school at UC Davis is like. 

My wait and see [thinking](http://edgibbs.com/2005/12/10/mba-checkbox/) from a year ago still holds:

  * Fully engaged as a development manager.
  * We&#8217;re still paying off my wife&#8217;s law school loans.
  * I need time to spend with my two daughters.

Good to know I&#8217;m not crazy for still considering an MBA at 37.
