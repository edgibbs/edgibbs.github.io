This week I scheduled a Sprint Planning Meeting to select the backlog on a project. Our normal time box for this meeting is about 4 hours. Since this is the 4th Sprint for this project and these meetings have generally only been going 90-120 minutes in the last few planning meetings I actually scheduled the meeting for only 90 minutes.

When the meeting happened we got into some important discussions around the Sprint goal and the largest feature for Sprint #4. Unfortunately much of this discussion really got going the last 30 minutes of the meeting. We couldn&#8217;t extend the meeting since the product owner had other meetings to attend, so we came to a quick conclusion and agreed to a slightly vague goal. 

The lesson here is you&#8217;re better off sticking to a half day schedule for the meeting even if you get through it in less time for most Sprints. I compounded the issue with only setting up the meeting a week in advance so I really couldn&#8217;t find a 4 hour window for the meeting at that point. Lessons learned.
