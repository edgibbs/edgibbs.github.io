I posted a little while ago about [IDE choice](http://edgibbs.com/2007/06/23/give-your-developers-ide-choice/) based on a developer having to use IntelliJ in secret because his shop mandated all developers must use Eclipse at all times. To avoid this sort of situation I pointed out that you should always have an automated build that has no IDE dependencies. Chances are if you have that no one can argue that you must use one particular IDE. 

Then there&#8217;s the second option:

> Then there&rsquo;s the shops that believe everything must be standardized. Avoid these standardization-happy shops.

Apparently the developer went with the [second option](http://www.boojies.com/2007/06/27/trying-to-use-intellij-in-secret/) and is looking to be successful elsewhere.
