I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to reading [The World is Flat](http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/worldisflat.htm) since I&#8217;ve had some downtime recovering from a nasty flu. It&#8217;s one of those talked about business books that you sort of need to read so you know when people are referring to it. Very simple synopsis is that everything in the world can now be outsourced and so competition is global. Then think of 500 pages of anecdotal examples.

Turns out AJAX has so much hype it even ends up in the book:

> Because these tools are delivered over the Internet and written in standard Web formats, they are accessible to anyone who has an Internet connection and are easily interoperable with any business. What enables work flow at this level is AJAX, a Web development technique that allows complex Internet business applications to be embedded into a Web page, then called up with a simple browser and accessed as easily as viewing a page on Amazon.com.
