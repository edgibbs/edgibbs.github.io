Sacramento&#8217;s Ruby community is beginning to organize for regular meetings. Our first meeting about three months ago was more of a introduction and chat session. Several members had been to Rails Conf 2007 and had plenty to talk about.

We met again at [Invision](http://invisionddg.com/) in Old Sacramento and talked about some organizational items:

  * Ryan is acting as our organizer and we&#8217;re glad to have his energy in the role.
  * Starting up regular monthly meetings. Looks like we&#8217;ll vote on the Google groups mailing list and the first Tuesday or Thursday of the month will be the candidates.
  * Meetings will be held at Invision as Old Sacramento is reasonably central to where everyone comes from.
  * We should have some short talks next time. One on the newer version of Capistrano and one on RSpec by myself. There was also a Django developer there who may do a talk on comparing current Rails and Django.
  * People were interested in hearing from [Mike Culver](http://www.cuberick.com/2006/11/mike-culver-amazon-web-services-and.html) on Amazon web services so I&#8217;ll try to contact him about scheduling a talk.

We also grew our second meeting from four to five people so we&#8217;re a bustling community.
