I remembered again today as one of our developers deployed [Confluence](http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/) why 30 day trials are so nice. Like many corporate shops we deal in purchase orders. If we had to wait to get our official license it could easily be 2 weeks before the PO clears with the vendor. In the meantime we can start out using the 30 day license and then just swap in the official license key in about two weeks with no delay.
