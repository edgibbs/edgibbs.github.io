Clunky but useful

I spent a good portion of the last two hours working with Eclipse to setup a tutorial project I&#8217;m building. As usual I had to brush up on my command line CVS including how to login remotely via SSH. Then it was numerous attempts to create a clean directory structure in Eclipse. Unfortunately it continuously wants to move directories around or create duplicates. After some struggle I have it the way I want though I&#8217;ll probably end up using ant to do the builds anyway.

It was a pretty good day at work. Everyone&#8217;s still treating me pretty normal. After Wednesday things may be very different, but at least everyone will understand why I&#8217;ve been a little out of it.
