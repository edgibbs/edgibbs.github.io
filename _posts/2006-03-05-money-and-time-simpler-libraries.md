Did a little hunting today into a [TimeAndMoney](http://timeandmoney.sourceforge.net/) library I came across from [Keith Ray](http://homepage.mac.com/keithray/blog/2006/02/25/). Nice to see an attempt to cover simple date and money functionality, since dates have always been a bit of a pain to deal with. I swear I have to look up some example code every time I do anything with dates in Java. And despite knowing better I often see floats used for money calculations and some interesting bugs tend to occur.
