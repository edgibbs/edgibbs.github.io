Just more self-reinforcing reasons to do SOA. It all comes down to the bottom line. If you&#8217;re pushing SOA as the CIO:

**Average Compensation of CIOs Working With an SOA**

  * $250,000

**Average Compensation of CIOs Working Without an SOA**

  * $159,000

My question is can you just brand whatever you&#8217;re currently doing as SOA. Then just deploy a web service or two and you&#8217;re a leading edge SOA shop? And if that works can you walk into the CEO and ask for a $100,000 raise?
