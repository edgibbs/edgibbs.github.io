I recently posted about how [Scrum + some XP practices](http://edgibbs.com/2006/09/12/scrum-with-some-xp-practices-in-the-lead/) isn&#8217;t necessarily the most common Agile methodology type. This [survey](http://www.versionone.net/surveyresults.asp) from Version One seems contradict my idea. Still hard to tell claim any hard proof from self selecting surveys.
