I implement my personal organization system in 37 Signals [Backpack](http://www.37signals.com/). I&#8217;ve had a subscription now for about 15 months and its been the best way I can find to maintain David Allen&#8217;s [GTD](http://www.davidco.com/) method. After a lot of experimentation including trying out other tools such as just tracking everything on [index cards](http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda/), or using [Kinkless GTD](http://kinkless.com/) with Omni Outliner, I kept coming back to Backpack as the best available solution for me. The major bonuses are:

  * It&#8217;s an online service so I can access it from home on my Macs and from work on my PC, and even on my Treo.
  * The core feature for me is a very simple way of adding lists. Just click, type, and return any time you want to add a todo on a page.
  * When you need something that has a few steps, ie a project, you just add a new page.
  * You can add just about anything to a page including images, files, and notes. I have 115 or so pages now and some of them are just things like notes on how to upgrade cruisecontrol or a list of potential future projects in our pipeline. A nice personal wiki.
  * They keep adding features which make it more valuable. This is the real glory of online hosted applications. You keep picking up features with no install/upgrade hassle, it&#8217;s why I liked the ASP model all along even when it became associated with the dotcom bust.
  * There&#8217;s even a client app so you can have a local offline backup using [Packrat](http://infinitenil.com/packrat/).

The new feature utilizing [movable list items](http://backpackit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=6668) is going to really help out with something that drove me crazy. Today in backpack you can move around items in a list, but you can&#8217;t effectively move items between multiple lists unless they are right next to each other. My main context page that lists most of my todos by context area has:

  * Inbox
  * @Computer
  * @Office
  * @Agenda
  * @Home
  * @Home Computer

The idea was dump things in my inbox, then drag them into the appropriate context when I have time to process things. The problem was I generally had to cut and paste the item to move it negating any ease of use. This new feature really solves that problem.

Now I just need the ability to move list items between pages, or the ability to tag individual list items.

(Apologies if this was to GTD geeky.)
