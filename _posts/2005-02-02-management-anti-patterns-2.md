How not to lead techies

Managing techies, geeks, rocket scientists, and software engineers is hard work and more of an art than a science. Still given the current techie focus on [patterns](http://www.awprofessional.com/series/series.asp?st=44117) or more importantly [anti-patterns](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AntiPatternsCatalog) I&#8217;m prepared to share my delicately researched opinions on the anti-patterns of technical management. And I&#8217;m willing to ignore that fact that the bulk of my management experience is with techies and not other segments of society or the fact that I went to a die hard engineering school where I was informed more than once, &#8220;It&#8217;s not a UNIVERSITY, **it&#8217;s an Institute of Technology**.&#8221; My experience is universal darn it.

Over the next few months I plan to examine the many anti-patterns of technical management, many of which I&#8217;ve been guilty of invoking. I&#8217;ll look at anti-patterns from &#8220;Coding Manager&#8221; to &#8220;Business Requirements are for Business Analysts&#8221;.

For those of you who&#8217;ve been following my personal cancer battle, I&#8217;ve labeled myself a survivor again as I&#8217;m completely cured at this point. Thus I&#8217;m back to ranting about techie topics instead of how oncology doctors have trouble dealing in percentages when explaining your long term survival rates.
