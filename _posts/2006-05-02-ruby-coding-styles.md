I&#8217;ve been absorbing standard Ruby style by osmosis, but I did finally stumble across an actual [style guide](http://www.rubygarden.org/ruby?RubyStyleGuide) including one specific to [Rails](http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/CodingStandards). We use [_The Elements of Java Style_](http://www.ambysoft.com/essays/javaCodingStandards.html) for our java code at the office and it works pretty well. I like the comment:

> There is no place in Ruby where _lowerCamelCase_ is ever used.

I&#8217;m guessing that was specifically for us Java guys. Of course it&#8217;s a wiki page so that comment may not survive forever.
