It&#8217;s been about 7-8 months since we started to serious pilot Fitnesse on a project. Looks like its turning the corner. Instead of developers driving it, the QA staff are starting to build out acceptance tests and add scenarios. It&#8217;s coming in very handy for testing a huge number of edits based on a positional file format. 

I still wonder if we&#8217;ll evolve to tools beyond Fitnesse, but it&#8217;s starting to prove it&#8217;s value.
