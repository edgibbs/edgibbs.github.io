[Tim Shadel](http://timshadel.com/2005/02/16/zdot-podcast-team-reviews-with-the-jupiter-eclipse-plugin/) recommends when doing code reviews to review no more than 5-6 classes for a one hour review session. I violated that rule of thumb last week, and I can see how it burns you out just reviewing that much code ahead of time. And I have a feeling when we go through the review Monday we&#8217;ll run out of time unless we really push it.

At least it will allow us to better evaluate using a tool for the review process. We&#8217;re still waiting on the preview release of [Crucible](http://www.cenqua.com/crucible/), but now that most of our developers have been pushed into Rational Application Developer we are trying out the [Jupiter plugin](http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Tools/Jupiter/Core/doc/UsersGuide.html).
