A small milestone today. One developer deployed our first ever Fitnesse acceptance test on a real project. I sat down with him at his desk and clicked on the &#8216;Test&#8217; button. Soon after I had 4 green bars. This was a fairly straightforward edit, just checking that a city field was contained in a certain list of acceptable cities. I added two cases one for a city spelled out in lower case and one for a partial city name. Save the page and run the tests again. Six green bars.

Should make the Sprint Review a lot more visually exciting.
