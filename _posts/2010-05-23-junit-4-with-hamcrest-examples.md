I&#8217;ve been meaning to put together an example of all the Hamcrest assertions that have been added to JUnit 4 way back in 2007 now. My assumption based on a number of recent client engagements is that if unit testing is being done with JUnit the default is still to rely on assertEquals() as the default. I found developers were very enthused about the new assertThat() style if you showed them some examples. In order to better understand all of the new Core Matcher options I put together a little tutorial example of all the defined matchers.
