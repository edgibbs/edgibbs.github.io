I realized today as I was clicking through Dell configurations on workstation class machines with dual or quad core Xeons that I really needed to get my head out of the sand and delegate this. I&#8217;m not the world&#8217;s expert on all aspects of computer hardware other than I usually have a pretty good clue around Apple hardware, but that&#8217;s more of a techno-lust thing.

So after mulling it over I delegated it to one of my developers who can run with it, do a better job, and get it done faster.
