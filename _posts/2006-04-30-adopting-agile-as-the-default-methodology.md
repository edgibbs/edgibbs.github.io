Having been officially adopting Agile from the top down approach for about 8 months now I was really surprised by a recent project kickoff meeting.

I just assumed that we&#8217;d be using our official Agile methodology on this high profile project. Some assumptions I made were:

  * The two product owners, business analyst, project manager (ScrumMaster), developers, and QA tester all have prior experience on an Agile project.
  * We have two months to deliver on the project with no wiggle room because it&#8217;s a regulatory project, so if we fall back to our old waterfall style we&#8217;ll likely fail.
  * All of our official piloted agile projects have been successful ventures so far and viewed that way by their product owners.

I turned out to be on a different page then the rest of the room. There idea appeared to be that we would run this as a traditional project. Traditional for us means a sort of strange version of waterfall, but waterfall none-the-less. The problem is we could easily be weeks just getting the requirements in place in lengthy documents no one wants to read. (The system shall &#8230;)

I thought there was no way we&#8217;d allow for this, but it appears to be exactly what we&#8217;re going to do by default. So the question is how to fight this perception that Agile isn&#8217;t our default.

I fear that despite the pilot projects, many of the participants haven&#8217;t understood how powerful Agile is for just this sort of high profile, short deadline project. We&#8217;ve adopted pretty much vanilla Scrum up to this point so maybe they thought with 30 day iterations Scrum just couldn&#8217;t work. Given the timeframe I&#8217;d say we should be using maybe 1 or 2 week iterations. A truly lightweight process might be just a product backlog, a short planning meeting every week, daily standups and a short 30 minute review of the progress at the end of the week.

I&#8217;m not giving up though, maybe I can convince the players to hold an impromptu planning meeting tomorrow.
