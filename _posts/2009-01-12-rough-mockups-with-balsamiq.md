Not to long ago one of my developers came across a little mockup tool called Balsamiq and then I saw a post from [Clark Ching](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/typepad/clarkeching/itnbp/~3/492280350/some-nice-software-.html) who checked it out as well. I love the sketchy look and feel and rendering a quick mockup form was good fun. We&#8217;ll probably try it out on a future project and see if we can get some value out of it. Much like the Swing [Napkin](http://edgibbs.com/2005/10/23/napkin-look-feel/) look and feel the value is from being obvious that this is not to focus on look and feel, but more on the functionality of a web site.
