The [Rails Envy](http://www.railsenvy.com/) guys, Gregg and Jason, have put together a g[reat podcast](http://www.railsenvy.com/podcast) on current Rails news, packed it into 10 minute episodes and spiced it up with humor. You probably already know them from their parodies of the Mac PC ads with Rails versus Java, .NET, Coldfusion, etc. If you haven&#8217;t added the podcast to your feed and you keep any track of the Rails community it&#8217;s worth adding to your weekly podcast menu.
