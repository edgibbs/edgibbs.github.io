At my current company I&#8217;ve been going out to lunch pretty much every day I&#8217;m in the office. I know a lot of developers bring their lunches and like to eat alone in silence, but I&#8217;m probably less on the introvert side. I&#8217;ve always made it a point to have lunches with developers on a regular basis, but my current standing lunches with have been an evolution of that.

Breaking bread and catching up on stories, families, etc are a great way to bond with developers you don&#8217;t work with on a regular basis. Most of the engineers I go to lunch with work on another team, so I&#8217;m constantly keeping up to date with their current work and letting them know about what my team is doing. As a bonus I get out of the office and eat some hot food, though not necessarily the healthiest fare. Sharing and communication between teams really helps even in a flat startup organization like ours. I know some companies have meals catered in the office which works as well, but if you&#8217;re at a regular place, lunch out can work just as well.

As a suggestion if you tend to eat your lunches alone or at your desk, try to make a habit of eating out with some other devs or even other employees at least once a week.
