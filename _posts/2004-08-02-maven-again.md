The 1.0 release must be better

I really like the idea behind maven. Basically it&#8217;s an automated make tool that avoids the lenghthy configuration you can get into with ant. There&#8217;s only one problem. It seems to be incredibly buggy. 

I tried maven quite a few months ago, but I had trouble even getting it to load dependent libraries over the net. Eventually I got fed up and gave up. Then since I saw the 1.0 release I thought it might be worth another shot. An hour or so later after trying to setup a simple &#8216;cactus:test&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t get past target not defined errors and I just gave up again. Maven just isn&#8217;t there yet. You can really tell this when you try to look for help. After 30 minutes on Google I came up with nothing. Nuff trouble, I&#8217;ll stick with ant and it&#8217;s big configuration files.
