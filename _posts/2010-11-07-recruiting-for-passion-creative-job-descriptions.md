As a new manager recruiting for the first time you&#8217;ll find HR will usually provide you with a job description template. You&#8217;ll read it, laugh at how generic it is, and then try to do a bit of modification. That&#8217;s a futile effort. (Though depending on the organization you may have to leave pretty close to the strict confines of a template, in that case you&#8217;ll be working with a few custom bullet points you can work in.)

You&#8217;re actually looking for the most talented, passionate developers you can find given the opportunity, your location, and the relative pay rates provided. So how do you attract those people with a generic job posting? Instead you rewrite the position from scratch and ask for things like writing plugins to open source frameworks, giving presentations at conferences, or writing a technical blog. You want to attract developers who care about their craft and are going to bring up the overall level of your team.

So in short:

  * Keep it short a paragraph or two and bullet points. The meat of the content is in the bullet points.
  * Explain the challenges of your environment, if you&#8217;re a hardcore waterfall shop trying to shift to Agile be upfront.
  * Explain that mentoring is part of the job.
  * If you have the control you can even write the job description in a programming language.
  * Be very clear that bringing your passion to work is encouraged.
  * If you&#8217;ve won some of the wars with the furniture police, explain the nice hardware and multiple large monitors that are available, or even semi-private offices.
  * If other members of the team have some public blogs, or open source projects point to those as well to give them a feel for the team.
  * If you&#8217;re not in Silicon Valley or New York, sell the upside of your region (probably cheaper living).
  * If HR will let you point to some of the targeted job posting sites like [37 Signals](http://jobs.37signals.com/) or [Stack Overflow](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/).
