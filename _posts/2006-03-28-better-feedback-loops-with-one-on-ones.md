I&#8217;ve been running weekly 30 minute [one-on-ones](http://edgibbs.com/2006/02/15/nothing-to-talk-about-in-one-on-ones/) with all of my team for about [two months now](http://edgibbs.com/2006/02/06/one-on-ones/). With these meetings in place I go no longer than one week between giving and getting feedback from each employee.

Doesn&#8217;t sound like much. Like most managers I assumed I probably talked to all of my staff every week. What I often didn&#8217;t take into account is I didn&#8217;t always check in with everyone on a weekly basis. With the more self-directed employees or the slightly more introverted ones I only had brief discussions in the cube or hallways or maybe at the end of a meeting. 

Turns out rapid feedback loops, even 30 minutes once a week, allow your employees notify you when things are a bit off course. Maybe they&#8217;re underutilized on a project or frustrated with a work situation. Maximum time to find out is one week on something like this. Sure, some employees will bring this your attention sooner, and they probably should, but having a regular discourse guarantees your employees have a chance to inform you.

In the last two weeks this feedback loop helped me become aware and fix two situations that were really demotivating several employees. There&#8217;s really nothing better than a re-motivated employee. So so far the one on ones are paying significant dividends.
