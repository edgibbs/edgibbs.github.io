Listening to episode #16 of [Code Sermon](http://www.codesermon.org/) this week the, the host made an editorial comment about a trend in podcasts having a couple of minutes audio intro.

> It seems like filler and I don&#8217;t think we need filler in this new medium. 

I&#8217;ll have to second this. The point of podcasts is the content. I don&#8217;t mind a short audio lead-in as a way to brand a particular podcast, but beyond 20 seconds or so it just starts to seem excessive.

Some podcasts also tack on a podsafe song at the end. This is less of a problem as generally I just skip ahead to the next podcast.
