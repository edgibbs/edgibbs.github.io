&#8220;Heh, can I just take this call I&#8217;ll be right back.&#8221;

I never got a chance to answer he just took the other call. Waiting patiently for about three minutes thinking should I just end the telephone screen now or be polite. I can overhear him talking to someone saying, &#8220;No big deal I&#8217;m just doing a phone interview. Yeah we can order some pizza later.&#8221; He apparently was talking on his cell and leaving me on pause on the land line.

&#8220;OK, sorry about that, I just needed to answer the call.&#8221;
