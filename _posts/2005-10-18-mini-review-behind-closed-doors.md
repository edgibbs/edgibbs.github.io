I had high hopes for [Behind Closed Doors: Secrets of Great Management](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rdbcd/index.html) by Johanna Rothman and Esther Derby. I&#8217;ve generally had good experiences so far with the Pragmatic Publishers. I&#8217;ve probably purchased about half of their titles at this point and I even occasionally listen to Andy Hunt&#8217;s podcast. 

They hype on this made it seem as if there might be some real revelations or new ideas, but my feeling after shooting through it last night is that it&#8217;s not bad, but not a great title either. The book just lacks some quality to keep you reading and follows a well known management book paradigm. Basically you follow some fictional character through a series of meetings where the great management wisdom is revealed. I did find it interesting that I&#8217;ve listened to [podcasts](http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail392.html) by Johanna Rothman and found her real stories to be a lot more engaging.

The book covers the following topics among others:

  * **One on Ones** &#8211; Nothing really new, but after a recent spate running across this in the [Manager&#8217;s Tools](http://www.manager-tools.com/) Podcast and a Ken Blanchard seminar or two I&#8217;m going to try implementing them seriously for a few months.
  * **Coaching** &#8211; This is something I do a good bit of already, could do better, but no real major new tips here.
  * **Delegation** &#8211; I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m that great at this, but I didn&#8217;t really come across any new techniques here.
  * **Feedback** &#8211; Obviously feedback is critical. The suggestion is to give it quickly and focus on behavior not emotional responses.
  * **Effective Meetings** &#8211; They cover general meetings, weekly team meetings, and 15 minute standup meetings. All good information, but again no real new tips.
  * **New Hires** &#8211; I liked the part about setting up a checklist for a new employee. I&#8217;ve found this to be important many times. And spending a lot of time preparing for interviews leads to better hires.
  * **Project Portfolio** &#8211; Basically track your major projects and keep track what&#8217;s going on over the next month or so. I&#8217;d be surprised how many managers survive without this for long.

So as a technical manager you learn that general management practices apply to you. It&#8217;s all good information, but not revolutionary. Part of the problem may be that I&#8217;ve been a technical manager for 3+ years already so maybe I&#8217;ve crossed the line for a book like this to be terribly relevant. The thing that makes me think differently is I&#8217;ve listened to most of the recent podcasts at [Manager&#8217;s Tools](http://www.manager-tools.com/) and they manage to cover the same topics, but I find myself really reacting strongly to their presentation. They reference real stories and debate some finer points of the topics like whether you should take One on One notes on a Tablet PC versus paper. And it could be the audio presentation is more effective, but I&#8217;m generally a visual learner.

Anyway I&#8217;ve picked up [Prefactoring](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/prefactoring/) by Ken Pugh and so far it seems like an intriquing read.
