I spent some time evaluating tools like Rally, ScrumWorks, and XPlanner about 6 months ago. After investing some time with XPlanner and some configuration hell, I [dropped it](http://edgibbs.com/2005/08/29/dropping-xplanner-for-now/) after a few weeks on a Sprint because the workflow was more of a headache then just using corkboards, index cards, and Excel.

In another little bonus from the Certified ScrumMaster course I bumped into [Victor Szalvay](http://www.danube.com/blog/victorszalvay), one of the founders of Danube Technologies the creators of [ScrumWorks](http://danube.com/scrumworks). He quickly informed me that they had dropped the licensing on ScrumWorks and now offered it for [free](http://danube.com/blog/laszloszalvay/scrumworks_free_danube_growing_scrumworks_growing.html). Definately back on my list to check it out, especially now that I&#8217;ve got a better idea of what we need in a tracking tool.
