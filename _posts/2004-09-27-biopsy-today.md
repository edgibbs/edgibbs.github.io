Small Things

Tomorrow is the biopsy, so no more food tonight. I have that drilled in, no food past midnight. Anyway I finally spent spent some time researching the part that worries me the most about my upcoming treatment, unless of course I get really lucky and the biopsy shows something besides cancer&#8211;bone marrow transplant. Of course I read about it during the first occurence, but it seemed like a fairly distant possiblity. Anyway according to the [article](http://www.nbmtlink.org/sg.asp#resource) I might even be able to swing an outpatient transplant, which would really rock. So it shouldn&#8217;t be as bad as my mind keeps imagining.

We talked to our oldest daughter tonight. Luckily for our little three month old she&#8217;ll just ask questions many years later about Daddy&#8217;s hair or lack of. Anyway she seemed slightly interested as we explained I had cancer, and that I had to take powerful medicine for it. She seemed more interested in washing hands and being in charge of Daddy&#8217;s water bottle, for I am a notoriously bad drinker of plain water. So naivete is bliss in this case.
