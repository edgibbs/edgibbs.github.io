This week I have 3 standups a day:

  * **9:15am** Scrum Master on a Proof of Concept project.
  * **9:30am** Chicken on an internal project.
  * **9:45am** Chicken on a large systems project in another building.

The disadvantage is I&#8217;m running around a lot. The advantage is I get a view into every project on my team every day.
