Only a few more treatments to go

This is going to be pretty short, becuase I forgot about the chemo side effects. I went into the &#8216;infusion center&#8217; today and got shot up with:

  * Some prednisone (solamide?) like steriod
  * Saline
  * BP 16 (the E in RICE)
  * rituxin

On top of that I took a few pills, two tylenol and two benadrils. I had forgotten how much fun it all is. For the first five minutes I felt a little woozy as the saline got pumped in to my new little portocath. Then I pulled it together and worked on my two computers and read some technical books and a graphic novel. Only issue turned up about 2:00 when I got an itchy red scalp and they had to stop the rituxin and give me some more solamide to calm down the allergic reaction. So now I&#8217;m allergic to rituxin and compazine.

Anyway I&#8217;m tired, food tastes a little funny, and the low grade naseau is back already. But I got to kiss my daughters goodnite so things are still pretty good.
