I&#8217;ve been cruising through the first few chapters of [Fit for Developing Software](http://www.phptr.com/title/0321269349) by Rick Mugridge and Ward Cunningham. It&#8217;s a pretty good read as I finally feel like I have a good handle on how to wire [Fitnesse](http://fitnesse.org/) to Fixtures and Fixtures to my code. I&#8217;m actually really kicking myself a bit because we just wrote a custom regression testing tool for one of our projects that Fitnesse would have handled a lot more cleanly.

The Fitnesse docs are good, but somehow I really missed the link between how to wire up the Fixture classes. Sometimes its just better to wait for the book. They did decide to split the book into for general business users and developers. I&#8217;m not sure many business users could be convinced to read it though. Sort of like the idea that business experts will write business rules in some pseudo English rules language.
