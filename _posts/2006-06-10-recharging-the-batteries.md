My personal recharging battery techniques, for those times when you just can&#8217;t stomach another article on the newest web framework.

  * Disconnect where reasonable. Sometimes on vacation this is pretty easy, but since you&#8217;re a bit burned out and still probably at work, concentrate on some of the non-technical aspects of your job that don&#8217;t get looked at enough.
  * Take a temporary ban on reading technical books, listening to podcasts, etc.
  * Play mindless games. I prefer to play mindless card games like [Munchkin](http://www.sjgames.com/munchkin/game/) or [Nuclear War](http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/nucwar.htm) with a group of friends, but since I don&#8217;t have that many old geek friends who still play these games nearby, a mindless video game will often suffice. Just not a mindless massive multi-player online game, because I have a dangerous propensity to get sucked into those.
  * Hang out more with the fam.
  * Remind yourself that some personal project can wait a week while you have some downtime.
  * Read a fiction book. I rarely read anything but technical books, given how much I try to keep up on, but sometimes it&#8217;s good to take a break and read some fiction.
