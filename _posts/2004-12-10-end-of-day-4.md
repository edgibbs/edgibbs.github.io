So far I&#8217;m surviving

Not a lot of enery to night, but between Micki and I we got a dialup setup. This probably means video conferencing won&#8217;t work tomorrow, but we&#8217;re going to attempt it. Right now the worst part is the nasaua that leads to acid reflux and vomitting, but so far only twice and I&#8217;m getting some more meds for it.
