Generally if a Scrum Master is off on vacation the role should temporarily fall to someone on the team to cover the standups, attempt to remove impediments, and generally keep things moving. 

What doesn&#8217;t work that well is having another Scrum Master who has no relation to the project step in help. They don&#8217;t have any context to work from and at most they&#8217;re going to mechanically record status updates on tasks. Maybe they can try to remove some impediments, but again they lack context.

Given a choice leave it up to the team who fills in the Scrum Master role while they&#8217;re on vacation.
