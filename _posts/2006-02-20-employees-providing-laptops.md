According to [Gartner](http://blog.gartner.com/blog/index.php?blogid=8&itemid=385) by 2008 at least 10% of employers will require laptops to be provided by employees. All I can say is I certainly hope so. I&#8217;ve used my personal laptops for at least three employers in the last 6 years.

I&#8217;d much prefer to use my more productive Mac laptops versus your generic IT provided Dell laptop. The unwritten conclusion I can make is though they&#8217;ll require an X86 laptop running some specific version of Windows. Unless things like [AlienWare](http://www.alienware.com/Product_Pages/notebook_all_default.aspx) and Apple [laptops](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/) show up in some laptop magic quadrant.
