There&#8217;s been quite a stir over some documentation on MSDN about how to do TDD with Visual Studio 2005. Essentially it advocated writing all your tests first for a a particular class and then starting to implement the tests and get them to pass one by one. Sort of Big Design Up Front with Tests. Gee, might as well do a lot of UML diagrams and get the same effect. Basically what they were advocating was a TDD anti-pattern.

Anyway the community spoke up pretty quickly and loudly including [Michael Feathers](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=137207), [Ron Jeffries](http://www.xprogramming.com/Blog/Page.aspx?display=SadMicrosoftPosting), [James Shore](http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Microsoft-Gets-TDD-Completely-Wrong.html), and others. So it&#8217;s [gone](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182521.aspx) now and this is the Microsoft [explanation](http://blogs.msdn.com/robcaron/archive/2005/11/22/496086.aspx).

Fairly impressive that this got changed so quickly.
