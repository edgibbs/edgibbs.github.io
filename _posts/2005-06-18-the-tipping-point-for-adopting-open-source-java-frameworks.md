Last I remember there were some 80,000+ open source projects. There&#8217;s a whole host of different solutions out there that solve the same problems. The MVC framework space is overflowing with Struts, Webworks, Velocity, JSF, and a host of others. The ORM frameworks include iBatis, Hibernate, JDO, and a bunch of others.

There&#8217;s a few rules of thumb I tend to use for whether it&#8217;s worth adopting something:

  * It keeps turning up on popular java sites like The ServerSide (TSS).
  * Multiple books have been written on it. One book is never enough, because there&#8217;s plenty of one off books on ideas that never really took off. SQLJ comes to mind off the top of my head.
  * It solves a specific limited problem domain and relies on things like simple POJOs for its implementation.

At this point the framework is probably worth a look. Right now I&#8217;m looking into the Spring framework as a good way to make our applications more testable. After I get through O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s [_Spring: A Developer&#8217;s Notebook_](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/springadn/) I&#8217;ll have a better idea whether it&#8217;s worth adopting.
