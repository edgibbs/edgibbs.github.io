OK, it&#8217;s the end of 2006, but at least our development shop can return to Java 1.5 when IBM releases a new version of RAD in the second half of 2006. There exact words from the [press release](http://www-306.ibm.com/common/ssi/fcgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=AN&subtype=CA&htmlfid=897/ENUS206-076&appname=USN) are:

> IBM intends to ship a new version of Rational Application Developer in the second half of 2006.

I&#8217;m just going to hope for the best here, but realistically I bet the next version of RAD may slip to 2007.

The more interesting statement is:

> Full Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) 5.0 support across all offering&#8230;

This statement concerns me. They make absolutely no comment on Websphere Portal Server. Currently the boat anchor in our web stack is Websphere Portal Server 5.1. If I&#8217;m reading this correctly, they say there going to support Java 1.5 across all their offerings, but they&#8217;re not going to release a new version of Portal Server. Hopefully this was just an oversight in marketing.

At least I&#8217;ll get a chance to ask some actual IBM Websphere folks in person this week. The first question will be when Portal Server will finally get upgraded to support Java 1.5.
