I stumbled across a [post](http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2007/01/05#RcovRakeTask) by Mike Clark on [rcov](http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?rcov) and how easy it was to get code coverage metrics. I&#8217;d installed rcov 0.6 like a year ago and it took forever to run and had other issues so I dropped any idea of seriously using it. Now trying 0.7 it appears to run perfectly well. So if you&#8217;re like me and really like coverage tools like Clover in the Java/.NET land rcov 0.7 appears to be a keeper.
