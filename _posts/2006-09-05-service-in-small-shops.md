I finally got around to updating the [Crucible](http://www.cenqua.com/crucible/) beta today. Crucible is a code review tool from Cenqua. Everything went fine until I started it up whereupon one of the update sql scripts failed. I went ahead and found a post on the exact same problem in their [forums](http://www.cenqua.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=2427&tstart=0) and uploaded the related file. Just four hours later the updated fix file showed up on their forums.

And this is for a beta product you can&#8217;t even buy yet. If this had been a call into IBM about a Websphere portal issue it likely would have been a day or so to get a response and a good possibility that we&#8217;d never get a fix without figuring out a workaround ourselves. And for this we pay the big bucks.

Small shops are just typically better about service, and they typically really need their customers. And just as a disclaimer we have purchased Cenqua&#8217;s Clover product and an Enterprise license to IBM&#8217;s Websphere suite.
