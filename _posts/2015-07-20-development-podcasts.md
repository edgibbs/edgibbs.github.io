Here&#8217;s my current podcast development list:

<div>
  Ruby Rogues is the default Ruby weekly Ruby podcast, plus they cover some non-Ruby topics here and there. It&#8217;s going on 4+ years now and still maintains a good degree of relevance.

<div>
  This is the oldest of the Thoughtbot podcasts. It covers a host of topics including some software management.

<div>
  Hanselminutes is my concession to keeping up with the .NET world and perspective. Hansel is very good about not diving deep on MS specific topics too often. And I just love his nearly dead podcast This Developer&#8217;s Life.

<div>
  This has been along forever associated with IEEE. I get the sense as the topics are tending towards less enterprisey that IEEE is finally catching up with the post Agile/Lean software world.

<div>
  This is a great little technical podcast with two Thoughbotters. They go deep on Rails, but swing into other technologies they&#8217;re playing with.

<div>
  Charles Lowell is a really old podcaster from the Drunk and Retired podcast. His company does a lot of Ember currently, but the often wander off into all sorts of technical topics.

<div>
  Turing Incomplete is a little gem I found a few months ago. It&#8217;s four developers from Philly who talk about what they&#8217;re learning each week, recent conference talks, or even cool keyboards.
