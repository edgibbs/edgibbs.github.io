Straight from Page 3 of 3 in the Dr. Dobb&#8217;s subscription survey:

Please answer the questions below and click submit.

12. Which programming languages do you know/use, or plan to **purchase** within 12 months? (select all that apply) 

  * VB 6.0 or earlier
  * Visual C++
  * .Net(any)
  * C/C++(any)
  * Cobol(any)
  * SQL
  * Eclipse
  * JAVA(any)
  * Modeling/UML
  * VB.Net
  * Visual Studio
  * IBM (any)
  * Oracle(any)
  * XML
  * C#
  * J2EE
  * J2SE
  * J2ME
  * PHP
  * JSP
  * Other

I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever purchased a programming language. I suppose some you might have to purchase some Oracle product to use PL/SQL, but is that really relevant. And is Eclipse a language. How do you purchase an open source IDE? Makes you scratch your head. And Dr. Dobb&#8217;s is a fairly technical magazine.
