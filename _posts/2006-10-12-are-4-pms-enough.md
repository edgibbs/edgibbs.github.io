At the end of a recent Sprint planning meeting, I realized we had the services of four separate PMs. Considering that&#8217;s over 50% of our available PMs I&#8217;m not sure why one project needed that level of help. I do know this particular project seems to be gathering up new documentation that **needs** to be done every Sprint. Time to start asking the &#8220;Does this add any value?&#8221; question.
