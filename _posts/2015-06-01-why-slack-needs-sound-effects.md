Not to be left behind in hipster group chats, we migrated from [Campfire](https://campfirenow.com) to [Slack](https://slack.com) a few months ago. It&#8217;s a slick, simple group chat system with a few elements of fun including custom emojis. We added Carl and Paul from [Llamas with Hats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZUPCB9533Y) to our custom set. We&#8217;ve also livened up things with a custom [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com)[](https://hubot.github.com). Still there is one very sad missing feature **Sound Effects**.

A bit of research shows the team at slack has had sound effects on its backlog for a long time:

    <a href="https://twitter.com/SlackHQ">@SlackHQ</a> Can Slack do sounds like Campfire ("/play soundname")? Silly as they may be, it's an essential feature for team camaraderie.

We&#8217;re more than a year later and still no sign of adding sound effects. We really relied on getting audio notifications of broken builds. Now things slip by for a while as the email or text notifications get lost amid the clutter. And sometimes you just need to play PushIt while deploying. Please Slack get this done.
