I&#8217;ve liked the ideas of war rooms for dedicated project teams for a long time. Especially on critical projects I think they produce some great communication benefits that outweigh any inconveniences of shared space. I realize this tends to be a bit split in the developer community.

[Brian Button](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/oneagilecoder/) in a [post](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/oneagilecoder/archive/2005/05/15/3412.aspx) argues that much of the problem is that managers who are in charge of making the decision generally love having their private office:

> From their own personal experience, they wanted their personal space, and they want to do good for their people. So they want to get them those private offices or cubes. 

I&#8217;m probably a bit of an odd duck for your stereotypical development manager: 

  * Wanted to step into people management despite being pretty technical. I&#8217;ve turned down an architect position or two that would have paid better than my current management position.
  * Enjoy understanding office politics (even an MS in Political Science)
  * Love doing business requirements even when this means day long meetings going into the finer details of highway lane closures or the tracking of parolees between precincts.

So I actually feel a bit odd having an office currently. I&#8217;ve started to put up whiteboards and cork boards everywhere and it&#8217;s regularly used for standup meetings. I actually prefer to be out on the floor despite the distractions. And the reality is I get interrupted about every 15 minutes anyway even with an office because I rarely close the door.

Anyway I had a really hard time on a large project getting the idea of a war room across. I was asked again and again how to get it back on track. I said putting the team in a war room would refocus everyone, vastly improve broken communication, and actually show that upper management thought the project was important enough to take over a precious conference room. In the end it never happened though I moved my developers over to cubicles across from the QA team on the project which had a significant impact though it wasn&#8217;t really as good as a true war room.

Over and over again I was told by fellow managers that we couldn&#8217;t move people because they liked their cubes. I also heard that they needed to sit next to their manager and couldn&#8217;t be moved to sit with a project team. Still things are finally starting to change. A small pilot agile project is kicking off soon with an actual war room being setup in an old HR training area.
