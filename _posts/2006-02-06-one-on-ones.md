After procrastinating setting up weekly one-on-ones I&#8217;m finally kicking them off. Everyone from the [Manager Tools](http://www.manager-tools.com/one-on-one-key-points-and-template/) podcast to the authors of [Behind Closed Doors](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rdbcd/index.html) suggest that this is a very powerful management technique to really help take your team to the next level.

I&#8217;ve already done a strange reverse experiment in setting up weekly one-on-ones with my manager and they&#8217;ve gone surprisingly well. Getting direct feedback on items from your manager on a weekly basis is powerful stuff.
