One of our senior developers is putting together a class mostly based on [Head First Java, 2nd Edition](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hfjava2/). The class will reinforce the basic language concepts for several of our developers who feel they still don&#8217;t quite get the point of inheritance or how an inner class works.

The developer explained that he was writing all the example code with JUnit and that [Head First Java 2nd Edition](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hfjava2/) has test classes and even mentions a process to follow of:

  * Prep for coding.
  * Test
  * Code

For some reason though they don&#8217;t follow through and just show you JUnit and instead end up writing main method test classes. Still it&#8217;s by far the best Java beginner book, I just wish they went ahead and introduced people to JUnit.
