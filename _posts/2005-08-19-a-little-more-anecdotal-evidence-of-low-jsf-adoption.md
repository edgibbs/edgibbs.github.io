[Matt Raible](http://raibledesigns.com/page/rd) commented in a [post](http://raibledesigns.com/page/rd?entry=wicket_is_the_most_widely) on [Wicket](http://wicket.sourceforge.net/index.html) that:

> In the past couple of months, I&#8217;ve spoke in front of 25+ Java developers on 4 different occasions to talk about web frameworks. I&#8217;ve asked those developers which frameworks they&#8217;ve used, or plan on using. Struts is still the most widely used, with WebWork and Tapestry the least used. Surprisingly, JSF seemed to be getting no traction among the the audiences I spoke to.

So without going looking for it I continue to see evidence that JSF isn&#8217;t exactly taking off. Not sure this just says that most IT shops are conservative on new tools, or JSF just isn&#8217;t quite ready for prime time. I&#8217;d guess the later, but I&#8217;ve only taken spent about 20 hours or so playing around with JSF, so I can&#8217;t really back that up.
