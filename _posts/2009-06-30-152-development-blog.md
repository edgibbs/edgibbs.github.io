I realized today that I&#8217;m [#152 on a list of the top blogs](http://www.noop.nl/2009/06/top-200-blogs-for-developers-q2-2009.html) for developers. Jurgen Appelo ([NOOP.NL](http://www.noop.nl/)) has been compiling lists like these for a bit now and this humble little effort manages to do pretty well. Jurgen himself has made a great effort to put out quality content on a regular basis with a management perspective. As there&#8217;s not a lot of software development managers posting these days it gives you some rare perspective if you&#8217;re a developer working for one of us pointy haired bosses.
