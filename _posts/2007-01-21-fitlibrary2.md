I watched a Google Talk [video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7618420216108922950&q=using%20fit) by Rick Mugridge on using FIT and towards the end of the talk he mentioned a mythical [FitLibrary2](http://www.nabble.com/Announce:-20061230-release-of-FitLibrary-in-Java-for-FitNesse-t2897135.html) which largely eliminated the need for writing Fixtures. I&#8217;m really not sure how this would work since he did a lot of hand waving around the issue, but apparently if you&#8217;re developing a really clean domain you shouldn&#8217;t need to use Fixtures at all unless you have to test the GUI layer or something similar. Sounds great, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll quite get it until I see some concrete examples.
