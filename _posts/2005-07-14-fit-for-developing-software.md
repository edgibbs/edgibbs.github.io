It looks like the book, [Fit for Developing Software: Framework for Integrated Tests](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321269349/ref=pd_sxp_f/002-7286224-1916864?v=glance&s=books) is out. Since we&#8217;re just about to embark on a project to make our largest application more testable and especially more testable for QA I hope this book has some good examples. I&#8217;ve spent some time with [Fitnesse](http://www.fitnesse.org/) and been able to get a basic understanding at this point, but I feel like I need to see some more real world examples to really get a handle on how you best implement it. Should be interesting to see how our QA department, which is largely used to manual testing, adjusts to it.
