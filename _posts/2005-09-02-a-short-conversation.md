I recently had a short conversation with one of my developers who&#8217;s worked at the company a good deal longer then myself.

<div class="codecolorer-container text vibrant overflow-off" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />2<br />3<br />4<br />5<br />6<br />7<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          <b>Jeff:</b> &nbsp;So the problem is the mainframe isn't returning the PDA.<br /><br /> <b>Ed:</b> And what is a PDA?<br /><br /> <b>Jeff:</b> It's a CVSN002.<br /><br /> <b>Ed:</b> Oh, so what is a CVSN002?<br /><br /> <b>Jeff:</b> It's a manifest.<br /><br /> <b>Ed:</b> Oh, so that would be in simple terms?<br /><br /> <b>Jeff:</b> Well, basically, a loan.<br />
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

The conversation would just be amusing as techie&#8217;s can get caught up in jargon really easily, but unfortunately these names are embedded in the methods, variables, and class names. Just love those CVSN002 classes. I believe the impenetrable names come from physical file locations on the mainframe, but as I&#8217;ve never been a mainframe developer I really don&#8217;t have a clue.
