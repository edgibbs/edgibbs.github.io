To give credit, I picked up this tip from [Elizabeth Hendrickson](http://www.qualitytree.com/):

> To check whether people are actually reading long technical requirements or design documents, liberally sprinkle the text with ridiculous quotes, like &#8220;My HoverCraft is Full of Eels.&#8221;

The basic idea is that very few people actually read long technical documentation. So why do we create long technical documents. Elizabeth related that she&#8217;s been doing this for a while, but very few people ever catch the phrases and thus very few people are reviewing these &#8216;important&#8217; documents.

She said she once had a developer who came up to her after reading something she sent around for reviews and asked about this hovercraft thing. Being from the QA/Testing side of the house, Elizabeth really liked working with this developer. As a manager I find myself creating very few of these documents so I haven&#8217;t had a chance to try it out yet, but I expect the experiment to be very enjoyable.
