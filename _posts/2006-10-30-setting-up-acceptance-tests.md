I&#8217;ve been intrigued with Fit/Fitnesse since Bob Martin introduced me to it at a session at SD West 2005. Of course that was about 18 months ago and despite playing with it a fair bit myself and even giving a talk on it at our [local JUG](http://edgibbs.com/2006/06/14/presenting-fitnesse-at-sacjug/), we still haven&#8217;t implemented it on any projects. Given that I&#8217;m unfortunately the resident expert on it, I think it&#8217;s finally time to push it directly even if that means doing some coding to show people how it could work on a real project. Now I just need to find time to keep up with the management duties as well.
