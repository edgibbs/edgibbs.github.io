Apparently [JB&#8217;s](http://www.jbrains.ca/weblog/browse) [entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/J._B._Rainsberger) on Wikipedia is up for deletion. He comments on the whole process of the debate around his deletion as:

> The whole experience makes me feel like I&rsquo;m in a room with people talking about me while not acknowledging my presence and not seeming to care what I think about that.

I can&#8217;t even believe there&#8217;s a debate around it. JB has obviously contributed much to unit testing, TDD, XP, and Agile in general. His book, JUnit Recipes, I still use as a reference when I run into a nasty testing problem. I re-read sections on testing EJBs just a few days ago and it was better than anything you can find by just googling around. He&#8217;s hosted workshops at XP conferences, run XP days, written a popular [JUnit tutorial](http://www.diasparsoftware.com/template.php?content=jUnitStarterGuide). I still love his post on [BDD](http://www.diasparsoftware.com/weblog/archives/00000110.html):

> What is Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)?
> 
> It is Test-Driven Development (TDD) practiced correctly; nothing more.

For all that work he really doesn&#8217;t deserve this sort of treatment.
