Spinning up on Groovy on Grails I pulled down the new 1.1 release. Started up a quick new project in my IDE. Change out my local GRAILS_HOME environment variable and it&#8217;s off to the races. After a number of strange errors I realized the IDE wasn&#8217;t quite updated to the 1.1 changes. I knew TextMate had Grails and Groovy support. It&#8217;s my default editor for Ruby so why not Groovy. It did take a minute to realize the svn repository for TextMate bundles had moved from:

http://macromates.com/svn/Bundles

to

http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/

An open TextMate window, a terminal session and a pretty minimized browser and I can fit everything in a single 17&#8243; window on my MacBook Pro. So far no issues and time spent messing with the IDE. Simplicity is inviting.
