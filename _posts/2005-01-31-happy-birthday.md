#### Made it to 35

After the last few months I was really happy to see my birthday. Micki and Kassie even did a surprise birthday party, and in an amazing show of patience Kassie didn&#8217;t leak a word. So life is very good.

Not much to report on the cancer front. Looks like I&#8217;ll be doing a little local radiation. Things have advanced so they can do &#8216;intensity modulated radiation,&#8217; without much extra risk. So 20 days of treatment to go and I&#8217;m all done. They&#8217;re quick and easy though compared to anything else.
