I got a pleasant surprise recently when I checked out the [Fitnesse.org](http://fitnesse.org/) site and found a fleshed out [Hunt The Wumpus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wumpus) example. Up until now the basic examples on the Fitnesse site were really too simple. The examples in the [FIT book](http://www.phptr.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0321269349&rl=1) are more elaborate, but I found the book itself to be one of those I put down because I just couldn&#8217;t get into the text.

Hunt the Wumpus brings back memories as a kid typing the code in from one of those big books of BASIC games.
