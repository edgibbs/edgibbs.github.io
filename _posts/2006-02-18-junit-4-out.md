Well it appears JUnit 4.0 has made it [out](http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=39048). Of course it&#8217;ll be a while until I can [use it](http://edgibbs.com/2006/01/29/java-15-is-very-far-away/) for anything since it&#8217;s 1.5 dependent and we have to wait for IBM and their wonderful Websphere line.
