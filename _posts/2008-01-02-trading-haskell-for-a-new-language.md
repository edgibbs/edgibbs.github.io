After committing to Haskell for my new language in 2007 it was largely a failed experiment. I never found a good learning Haskell book. I went through a few tutorials and nothing really clicked much. I found myself wanting to hack around on Ruby rather than mess around with Haskell syntax.

I really prefer a comfortable well-written book introduction to a new language. Something like the Ruby Pickaxe book or Learning Perl. Maybe this year will be Erlang or Common LISP since they both seem to have nice introductory books available.
