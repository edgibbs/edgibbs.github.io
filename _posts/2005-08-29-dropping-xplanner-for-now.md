Today I stopped bothering to update XPlanner. Part of the Agile method is to &#8220;do the simplest thing that works.&#8221; XPlanner wasn&#8217;t really a simple install, but once I adjusted to the user interface it made at least logical sense. The problem is:

  * I already track my Scrum projects on white boards with sticky notes.
  * I already use 3&#215;5 cards for user stories and tasks.
  * I do the time tracking, because time tracking really demotivates developers.
  * My developers are all collocated so they can see the white boards at the daily standups.
  * Tracking time takes way too many clicks. (I can see why they&#8217;re considering a nice friendly Ruby on Rails version with AJAX support)
  * The graphs only update once a day and really didn&#8217;t work that well for me.
  * Excel isn&#8217;t so bad.
  * It was just slowing me down and duplicating work I was already doing.

So I&#8217;ll toss a note to myself to check in on it maybe a year from now or look at a commercial option like [Rally](http://www.rallydev.com/?ppc=google&kw=rally) if I feel the need again, but for now I&#8217;m back to 3&#215;5 cards, white boards and Excel.
