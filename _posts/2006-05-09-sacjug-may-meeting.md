I attended the [SACJUG](http://www.sacjug.org/index.html) meeting tonight. They sometimes have a rough time rounding up speakers, and tonight was no exception. They had a talk lined up on AJAX, but their presenter bailed for a consulting job in LA. So we had a roundtable discussion for several hours.

As [Ted Neward](http://blogs.tedneward.com/) is still loosely associated with SACJUG and [Chris Scheuble](http://www.sacjug.org/members.html) mentioned that:

> Ted Neward is predicting Microsoft will move all their apps publicly to .NET according to Chris.

I guess that would be a lot of rewriting. Anyway I will probably buck up and agree to do a presentation on [Fitnesse](http://fitnesse.org/), both to force myself to spend more time with Fitnesse and to expose it to a few more people.
