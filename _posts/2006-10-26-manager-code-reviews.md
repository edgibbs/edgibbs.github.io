We&#8217;ve been holding code reviews for close to a [year](http://www.engineyard.com/whatyouget.html) now and the process has evolved from the first days. We&#8217;ve seen many of the common benefits:

  * Better code quality and readability.
  * Catching some defects early.
  * Mentoring opportunities around design.

We&#8217;re still a bit informal about it and probably reviewing less code than we should, but overall I&#8217;m pretty happy with the results.

That said I&#8217;m starting to weed myself out of more code reviews because I simply can&#8217;t keep up and I don&#8217;t need to be a bottleneck in the process. I really enjoy the break of a good 30-60 minutes of just reading and examining code and maybe running the corresponding tests, but I don&#8217;t have much time for it. Luckily we have enough senior developers now who have gotten used to the process and are able handle code reviews on their own projects.

As a manager code reviews can be important, but so are standup meetings, one-on-ones, staff meetings, removing impediments, planning out future project opportunities, and recruiting.
