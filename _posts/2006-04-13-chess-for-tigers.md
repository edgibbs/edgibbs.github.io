Listening to a really good [podcast](http://www.soenlive.com/2006/03/22/kathy-people-are-still-talking-about-you/) by [Kathy Sierra](http://headrush.typepad.com/) on Passionate Users she explained many of her themes on how to make users have more &#8220;I rule&#8221; experiences. One minor thing she might have gotten wrong is that chess is fun but not funny. As a former high school chess champion I can point to at least one classic chess book that proves chess can indeed be funny:

And if you are a chess player I advise picking up [Chess for Tigers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0080377882/102-1488157-4035354?v=glance&n=283155).
