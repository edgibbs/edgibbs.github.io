> Kids putting the final touches on a grand sandcastle while their dad hunches over a blackberry thumbs on the keys.

We take an annual family beach vacation every year. Two years ago my brother in law turned up with a Blackberry and was constantly checking email over the course of the week to the point of distraction. I&#8217;d seen a bit of this behavior in the workplace, but it was a bit disturbing to see a full fledged Crackberry addiction on a beach vacation.

The difference this year was my brother in law has actually kept his crackberry usage down a good bit, but I saw multiple people on the beach hunched over there phones pounding away. Their kids were boogey boarding, jumping in the surf, or building sand castles while they stared at a tiny screen. I&#8217;d never seen people on the beach pounding away on a Blackberry.

Personally I gave instructions to my tech lead who was covering while I was out to call me if any emergencies came up, but not to bother trying to get me via email because I wouldn&#8217;t be checking it. I didn&#8217;t get any calls. I follow the same policy when employees are out I&#8217;ll only contact for an actual emergency via a phone call.

I hope seeing the Crackberry&#8217;s at the beach will be the last time. [Studies](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/14/technology/14email.html?pagewanted=1) are starting to recognize the negative impacts on productivity around this kind of interruption driven existence.
