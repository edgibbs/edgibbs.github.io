One of the minor disappointments of [Ruby on Rails: Up and Running](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/rubyrails/) was that like so many other texts didn&#8217;t get to the testing topics until the last chapter. There reasoning was:

> We&#8217;ve come this far with our Photo Share web application, but we haven&#8217;t yet created any tests. In truth, this was deliberate. You had enough new things to learn as it was.

This isn&#8217;t because the authors think it was a &#8220;nice to have&#8221; topic since they declare that:

> &#8230;automated testing is probably the single most important thing you can do to increase the quality and reliability of your software.

It&#8217;s just that everyone assumes that testing is still not a mainstream assumption, so it&#8217;s a bit of an advanced topic to be looked at after you&#8217;ve debugged your way through all the tutorial features.

I&#8217;ll be really glad when someone just starts the darn book with testing and without needing to put TDD in the title.
