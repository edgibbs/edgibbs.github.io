Nurses state &#8216;fastest recovery ever&#8217;

More good news today. After my last catheter flush, the two senior nurses declared that I was the fastest bone marrow transplant they had ever seen and that it usually takes months to recover. Most people get to keep the port a lot longer before they&#8217;re comfortable pulling it out. So considering they do about 20-30 transplants a year there that puts me in maybe the top 1% of BMT patients. Good news is so much more fun than cancer relapses.
