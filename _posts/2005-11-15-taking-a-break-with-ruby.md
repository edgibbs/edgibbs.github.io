As I needed a break after prepping for and teaching a JUnit TDD class I dove lightly, feet first into Ruby last night. Since Ruby&#8217;s already comes with OS X this was even a bit easier than I figured. Just playing with Strings so far, but I really like that the unit testing package is in the core libraries, or at least I think it is, I&#8217;m really green at this point.

Anyway I could see some real benefits in having something like JUnit included with the core java libraries to really help encourage unit testing.
