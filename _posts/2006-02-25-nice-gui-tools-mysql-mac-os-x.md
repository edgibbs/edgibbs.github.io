I&#8217;m going through installing MySQL 5.0 on my G5 iMac so I can progress through the Agile Web Development with Rails book. One of my brothers is going though it and wants to bounce issues off me as he comes across them. Anyway I knew the installer had gotten very easy and that it included a control panel in the System Preferences, but now there&#8217;s a GUI [Administrator](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/administrator/) tool as well, nice.
