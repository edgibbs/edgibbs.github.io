[Jeff Sutherland](http://jeffsutherland.com/scrum/2004/05/scrum-pigs-and-chickens.html) covers the familiar Scrum metaphor about pigs and chickens:

<div class="codecolorer-container text vibrant overflow-off" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />2<br />3<br />4<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          Chicken: Let's start a restaurant!<br /><br /> Pig: What would we call it?<br /><br /> Chicken: Ham n' Eggs!<br /><br /> Pig: No thanks. I'd be committed, but you'd only be involved!<br />
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

I got kicked out of the pig pen today! We just started our first official Scrum project today with the first day of the Sprint. Unofficially I&#8217;ve run two Scrum projects already though I&#8217;m working more from book/blog knowledge than deep experience with Scrum.

We have a fairly knowledgeable consultant on hand coaching us on the process. The best thing of course, the whole reason you hire consultants, is that she has a lot more experience than we do with Agile methodologies with several large clients. So I&#8217;m pretty desperate to get any help I can get, especially help we&#8217;re paying for.

I sent a friendly email to the Scrum Master for this pilot project asking if I could attend the daily Scrum with one of my employees as chickens. I was very explicit that we would just be observers hoping to pick up some tips and tricks, and that we would probably only attend 1-2 per week. After about 4 hours I got an email back explaining that it was the Scrum Master&#8217;s role to protect the team from distractions so they don&#8217;t want us to attend since the team is very fragile. Clever argument since it is a central role of the Scrum Master, too bad we hadn&#8217;t proved we would disrupt the team in any way.

I think our organization has a long way to go to get Agile. Right now we&#8217;re too scared to share.
