I changed up the usual way I run the detailed part of our Sprint planning meeting with everyone coming up with tasks. For almost all prior meetings:

  * Stick selected backlog items for the Sprint up on the wall on giant stickies.
  * One by one lead the discussion on what tasks need to be done for each item.
  * Write each task down, come up with an hour estimate, and generally let someone claim the work or assign it to the team.
  * Repeat until finished with all backlog items.

Today at the suggestion of some of my developers on another project, I changed things up a bit:

  * Hand out large 5&#215;7 stickies and pens to everyone on the team.
  * Stick the backlog items on the wall.
  * People started to write down their tasks and walked up to the wall and pasted them under the backlog items.
  * Then I just facilitated walking through each backlog item and asking if we needed any more tasks and adding hour estimates to tasks that didn&#8217;t have them. In some cases team members just wrote down new tasks as they thought them up and added them throughout the discussion.
  * Repeat until finished with all backlog items.

Overall the experience was better, we got done a little quicker, and the tasks had the names the people doing the work had defined.

My hesitation to try this approach had come from one early Sprint on a project. I had handed out stickies to start the process, but almost everyone was new to Agile and they hardly wrote any tasks. In order to really pull out the tasks I had to stand up and really lead the discussion, writing down each of the tasks myself. As I got adjusted to working this way I just fell into a habit. 

It never hurts to reexamine and test your assumptions.
