This is a snapshot of an Excel Sprint Burndown spreadsheet for one of my projects. My employee, let&#8217;s call him George P. Burdell, isn&#8217;t allowed to be a Scrummaster. It&#8217;s political, but basically they want to move real slow with rolling out Scrum, so we&#8217;re doing it anyway in &#8220;super secret squirrel&#8221; mode. Hence funny little notations like this one.
