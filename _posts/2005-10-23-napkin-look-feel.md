Reading through Ken Pugh&#8217;s [Prefactoring](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/prefactoring/) I came across a mention of the [Napkin Look & Feel Toolkit](http://napkinlaf.sourceforge.net/). It appears to be a very slick representation of a swing environment which looks like it could have been scrawled on a napkin.

Too bad since we pretty much only do web apps I probably won&#8217;t get to use it. It could work generically for a UI, but some of the elements like a tree menu are a lot more trouble to put together in HTML. The danger is always that the client, even from a napkin drawing, can get the wrong idea about how the UI will function. Still I might experiment with it despite the danger.
