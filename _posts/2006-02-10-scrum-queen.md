ScrumMaster isn&#8217;t exactly the sort of job description someone goes looking for. As I remember Ken Schwaber explained that the term was specifically chosen to be uncomfortable because the process of adopting Scrum sucks.

The term reminds me of DungeonMaster from the old D&D days or more recently Webmaster. I actually think my job title was Webmaster at at least one company. At another one I remember working with another developer who referred to himself as the Webmaster and occasionally to me as the WebSlave. Not that that irked me at all.

Anyway we now have a Scrum Queen for one of our projects. The converted PM has rugby jersey embroidered with **Scrum Queen** on the back courtesy of a developer. I have to say that team is starting to gel. It&#8217;s their first Sprint and they&#8217;re already jumping in and having fun, which is one of the sure signs things are working.
