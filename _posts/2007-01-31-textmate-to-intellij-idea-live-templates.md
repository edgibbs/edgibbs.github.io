I had one of those weird cross-over experiences last night when I came across a small note in a post about the [history of Java&#8217;s origins](http://jroller.com/page/scolebourne?entry=are_you_scared_of_java). Ray Cromwell is quoted as saying:

> I program in a language that I would actually call &#8220;JetBrains Java&#8221; since I find I must drop into Live Templates often to refactor and reuse code that otherwise can&#8217;t be abstracted due to Java&#8217;s limited expressiveness.

After getting so used to snippets in Textmate I&#8217;ve come to really rely on them. And I never would have really gotten the power of snippets until I saw a few screencasts. Now I can use that same technique to use in IntelliJ IDEA even though I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ve had the feature for several years beforehand, I just didn&#8217;t really see how it could be so helpful. Apparently Eclipse has a similar template feature as well that we should look into in RAD.
