I&#8217;m digging into [Software Security: Building Security](http://www.swsec.com/) in by [Gary McGraw](http://www.cigital.com/~gem/) and I came across a strong opinion on C and C++:

> If you are concerned about buffer overflow problems and other basic software security bugs, don&#8217;t use C. If you must use C, use a source code security scanner. By the way C++ is even worse than C from a security perspective. C++ is C with an object model crammed halfway down its throat.

Ouch.
