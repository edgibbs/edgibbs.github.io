One of the developers from another team leaned over my cube wall this morning and very bluntly asked:

> So, why are you in a cubicle?

Given that it was 7:30 in the morning and no one else was around this was a bit jarring. I retorted that I moved out to the cubicle to make it easier to work with my team pairing up and helping with writing unit tests. That answer probably puzzled the developer a bit, and in truth there are quite a few reasons:

  * I always felt just a bit uncomfortable in an office. I remember being shocked having an office at first since I&#8217;ve managed from cubes or even tables on all my former jobs. It just still feels just the smallest bit elitist to be sitting in an office.
  * I do really want to be available to help with test infecting my staff.
  * When you&#8217;re out in the cube farm you overhear and see a lot that you miss from behind a wall.
  * My office has become more of a true project room, primarily used for standup meetings.
  * People can visually see if you&#8217;re available and get answers faster. I overheard a conversation the other day that an employee wished there was a green and red light over her manager&#8217;s office so she could tell when they were available without slogging over and peeking in the door.

Of course the downside of all of this is you&#8217;re probably interrupted more, but at the end of the day those interruptions are primarily from your own staff. And a manager&#8217;s primary job is to grow and serve their employees. At some point my goal is to get everyone on my team proactive and self sufficient enough that I pretty much eliminate the need for my position.

Since I moved out to the cubes about two months ago managers, PMs, admins, and others still express surprise that I wanted to move out onto the floor. I think for a whole lot of people an office with a door is still a very desired perk. Some of this may also be that I grew up with four other rowdy brothers so being in a busy, noisy environment and still being able to concentrate is something I take for granted.
