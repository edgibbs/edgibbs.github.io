Stumbled across this post by [Dave Churchville](http://www.extremeplanner.com/blog/) where he argues that [J2EE has killed of OOP](http://www.extremeplanner.com/blog/2005/12/how-j2ee-killed-object-oriented.html). I find it pretty close to the truth with the web applications we build. We don&#8217;t get to build a whole lot of first class objects. I find many of my developers haven&#8217;t grokked OO all that well, because J2EE largely allows them to ignore most of OO.
