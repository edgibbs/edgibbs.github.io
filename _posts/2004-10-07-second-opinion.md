Well, Tuesday we went out to Stanford and got a second opinion from a world renowned hematologist. Essentially his reccomendations were:

  * Get a bone marrow biopsy before starting chemo
  * Use RICE over RCHOP, 4 cycles
  * Do the bone marrow transplant now rather than later

Actually he explained that it was a stem cell transplant really, so they never actually harvest anything from the bone marrow. Anyway the Stanford oncologist who is much more of an academic still hasn&#8217;t gotten ahold of my oncologist in Sacramento, but here&#8217;s the regimen I&#8217;m looking at starting next week:

  * Tuesday the 12th &#8212; all day outpatient getting rituxin
  * Wed &#8211; Friday &#8212; in the hospital getting the rest of ICE

That&#8217;s all I know at this point since they&#8217;re still trying to finalize things. I won&#8217;t get a bone marrow biopsy before, but it really doesn&#8217;t make any logical difference since they&#8217;ll still have to do the chemo. This does mean I&#8217;m missing a lot of work starting very soon.

At least the waiting is pretty much over. And hey, hospitals may be more fun than I think
