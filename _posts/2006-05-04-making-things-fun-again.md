Every so often, work just seems like, well just work. At that point motivation goes down the tubes and you&#8217;re just slogging through. Drawn out architecture discussions on the benefits of paranoid security got me to a very un-fun state. Bad enough when you&#8217;re a solo developer, but even worse if you&#8217;re a software development manager and your mood is likely to rub off on the whole team.

Maybe it&#8217;s time to inject some fun courtesy of some Cruisecontrol powered [lava lamps](http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/cgi-bin/pragauto.cgi/Monitor/Devices/BubbleBubbleBuildsInTrouble.rdoc).
