Apparently we&#8217;ve been running Type A Scrum as defined by Jeff Sutherland in a [paper](http://www.agile2005.com/RP10.pdf) from Agile 2005. He&#8217;s divided Scrum into 3 types:

  * Type A Scrum &#8211; Everything is done in the Sprint, but there is downtime of a week or two between each Sprint.
  * Type B Scrum &#8211; You start to overlap the product backlog definition for the next Sprint into each Sprint resulting in no real downtime between Sprints.
  * Type C Scrum &#8211; Jeff Sutherland&#8217;s nirvana where you have overlapping Sprints.

Our experience so far is that we have been running Type A Scrum with gaps between each Sprint. I&#8217;ve had a lingering question over whether this was supposed to happen which this paper helps answer. Since we&#8217;re in early adoption and getting everyone up to speed this is pretty much expected, but it will be nice if we can evolve into a Type B Scrum without the time between Sprints.
