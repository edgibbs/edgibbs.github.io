I realized today my former office has officially become a [team room](http://edgibbs.com/2006/07/20/team-room-reality/). One of my employees came by to talk and I had to guide us to another meeting room because an ad-hoc meeting had started after one team&#8217;s daily meeting. Feels like a lot better use of the space.
