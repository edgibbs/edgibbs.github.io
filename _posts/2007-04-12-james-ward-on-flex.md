[James Ward](http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/) from Adobe came out to give a presentation on Adobe Flex. Some of the demos were really impressive, especially the one with a simulated book that you could turn over and fold pages on. He covered Apollo as well. He&#8217;s touring around as a general evangelist.

The SACJUG peppered him pretty well with questions. Any new tool/framework especially one that isn&#8217;t fully open source will always raise eyebrows with developers. He got a few questions about whether it could run on 64 bit Linux versions. Turns out it can, but there are some caveats about running it in 32 bit emulation.

Flex is a front-end framework utilizing Flash and ActionScript (aka Javascript 2). You can hook it up to back end data services as well. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll probably be using it in our shop anytime soon, but it never hurts to keep up with these things. And next time my web developer [brother](http://www.three40.com/) asks me working with Flex I&#8217;ll know what he&#8217;s talking about.
