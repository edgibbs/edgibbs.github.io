Some of the toughest problems on projects are caused by pulling together a group of individuals. Often one or more don&#8217;t work out.

On an Agile project you commit to your work every day and explain what you accomplished the day before. There&#8217;s nowhere to hide hours of surfing the web or spending a whole day writing a few lines of code. Productivity and effectiveness are evaluated every day. If you&#8217;re struggling but really trying the team will pull together and try to help out. Just putting in time by sitting in your cubicle for 8 hours a day and attending the standup isn&#8217;t enough.

At this point it becomes a management issue. Scrum puts pressure on management to act. Jump in, give the difficult feedback and get the employee on track. Management isn&#8217;t just about having an office, filling out budgets, and running team meetings. Management is defining expectations and helping people live up to them.

If line management can&#8217;t arrive at resolution it becomes an organizational issue. As Scrum or other Agile approaches expand and become the norm the organization must adapt. Letting a team flail with a weak link is unacceptable. Large scale organizational change is hard. Ken Schwaber&#8217;s estimate is only 20% of organizations will successfully complete a Scrum implementation.
