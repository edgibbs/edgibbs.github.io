Back in June I went through the pain of trying to make my way through [Spring: A Developer&#8217;s Notebook](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/springadn/index.html). It turns out that [Bruce Tate](http://today.java.net/pub/au/186) himself admitted that the book was badly done in his Amazon [one star review](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596009100/ref=cm_pdp_review_teaser_product/104-9123233-7993537):

> My appologies to all readers, and O&#8217;Reilly customers. I let you down. There&#8217;s no other way to put it. This book&#8217;s quality sucked.

Makes me feel justified in my [frustrations](http://edgibbs.com/2005/07/05/spring-a-developers-notebook-versus-pragmatic-project-automation/). It does bring up huge issues about O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s editing standards. If most the examples don&#8217;t actually work how did this ever get published?
