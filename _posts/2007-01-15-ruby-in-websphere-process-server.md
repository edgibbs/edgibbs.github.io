Turns out IBM recently snuck out a way to [integrate ruby](http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/scarubycomponent) with Websphere Process Server using SCA (Service Component Architecture). It&#8217;s incredibly enterprisey and a bit surprising to see out of IBM. And the whole thing is made possible via JRuby.
