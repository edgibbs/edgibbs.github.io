More than a year ago we lost a good engineer to a new opportunity. I knew that engineer would be hard to replace, but I did not expect to still be trying to hire a replacement a year later. I haven&#8217;t seen this sort of tight market for developers since the height of the dotcom boom more than 15 years ago.

We&#8217;ve had trouble at multiple stages in the recruiting process. We&#8217;ve had trouble getting a good funnel, we simply don&#8217;t have many candidates. We have a robust interviewing process for Sacramento, but probably simpler than the process many Bay area startups use. And more and more we&#8217;ve had people decide to turn us down before and even after offers. One person simply emailed us to let us know just before an interview that &#8220;it wouldn&#8217;t be in either of our best interests&#8221; to conduct the final interview. Others have let us know that our business just doesn&#8217;t have enough of world changing mission.

I&#8217;ve also seen more candidates describing themselves as architects. Almost all of them have turned out to be more in the range of mid-level developers. There was a similar overstating of skills when the last dotcom started sucking up anyone who could spell HTML. 

I don&#8217;t have any solutions to our year long hiring failure, but it&#8217;s time for us to try something different.
