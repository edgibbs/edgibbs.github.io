It&#8217;s almost always good to bring food to a meeting, particularly a longer planning type meeting, and I suck at it. The last time I brought food was to a TDD seminar I ran and I managed to bring peanut M&Ms and two people in the training session were allergic to peanuts.

I used to be better about this when I worked in consulting shops. Consulting shops never had issues with providing food and expensing it, especially for client meetings. Working inside a traditional company we have zero expenses for this and even the minor project celebration budget we used to have got slashed a while back in some silly budget cutting measure.

Not much of an excuse though, bagels or small candies are pretty cheap for the overall effect.
