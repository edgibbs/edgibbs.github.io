Quoting from [Brian Marrick](http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/) in a recent [post](http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2005/09/30#first-mover):

> Bob Martin said at Agile 2005 that industry seems to be converging on a standard Agile approach: Scrum with a subset of the XP practices.

I&#8217;d have to say that&#8217;s pretty much the path we&#8217;re headed down at my company. We tend to stumble more in the XP practices arena especially in the area of unit testing. Scrum by itself is fairly easy to adopt since it mainly specifies a few simple project management practices, though getting a true product owner to be involved has often proved fairly difficult. It would seem that soon we&#8217;ll just have an loosely defined &#8216;Agile&#8217; methodology.
