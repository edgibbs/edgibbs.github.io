I overheard this term mentioned in a [podcast](http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail693.html) by Anne Thomas Manes and for a minute I thought it might actually be the name of a real WS spec. The WS* specs are a [horror shop](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/04/01/WS-Mumble) of standards gone wrong. Every time I start reading up on the newest WS* spec I just end up with a spinning headache.
