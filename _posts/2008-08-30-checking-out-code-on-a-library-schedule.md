Your local public library lets you check out books for a few weeks at a time. Developers shouldn&#8217;t ever use this as a model, but it can happen. A developer new to a language or framework is afraid to check in. Instead they wait sometimes weeks before checking in their first code. My idea of an ideal checkout time is 15-30 minutes. A day is really an extreme edge case.

Of course the shocking issue is some developers still don&#8217;t even use source control at all.
