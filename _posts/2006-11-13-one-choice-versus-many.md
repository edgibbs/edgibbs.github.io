At some point choice is overwhelming. Bruce Tate talks about this in [From Java to Ruby](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/title/fr_j2r/):

> Certain tiers of development may be fairly well established, but others like the web presentation tier, offer a staggering lineup of choices&#8211;Struts, JavaServer Faces, WebWork, Tapestry, Rife, Spring Web MVC, and many others. On this tier, the safe choices are among the least productive.

The really sad part is this has been the situation since about 2004 after Struts or Struts Classic as it is now called had become dominant. JSF was offered as the obvious successor and instead we ended up with dozens of successors. In comparison Ruby has the dominance of Rails.
