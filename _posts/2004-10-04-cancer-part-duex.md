Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma

Well, we learned the biopsy results today. As it turns out, good news indeed, it&#8217;s the same as last time, Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma. It happens to be the most common type like 30-40% of all lymphomas. It also happens to be curable. And on top of all that since it just showed up in my neck again, it&#8217;s Stage I which is the best of the four stages.

My oncologist didn&#8217;t nail down the exact treatment regimine, but he&#8217;s leaning towards 6 cycles of RCHOP over RICE or something like that. He&#8217;s also not really sure I need to do a bone marrow transplant at this point given that it is Stage I. It turns out with another relapse you can do the bone marrow transplant then. But given that he wants us to check with Stanford, because they have different ideas on things.

I&#8217;d like to think I can just do some RCHOP and be done again, but I&#8217;m not getting my hopes up to high. Better to be prepared for something big like a bone marrow transplant still. So we&#8217;ll see tomorrow. I did find a [pretty good blog](http://www.lymphomajournal.com/journal.html) on lymphomas with RICE and a BMT by a younger guy in Utah. It didn&#8217;t sound like it was too rough for him.

Tomorrow is second opinion at Stanford.
