Many of you out there probably never saw my wonderful catheter, and certainly not the 90% of it that stays under the skin. It&#8217;s been my unfortunate pal since mid-November. Anyway it&#8217;s coming out finally on Monday morning. That will leave me almost completely normal and almost done with treatment. Apparently they don&#8217;t even have to put me under to pull it out. And my skin which has been bandaged around it will finally get to breathe. You can get some pretty cool blisters having your skin bandaged up like that so long. The picture is from a medical supply company, so 90% of that stays under your skin.
