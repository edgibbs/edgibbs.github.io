Ran across a wonderful rule when putting together your annual goals.

> &#8220;A goal that a dead man can meeting is pretty useless.&#8221;

Some potential dead man&#8217;s goals:

  * Improve automation on projects.

All I need to meet this goal is a single developer with an ounce of effort to create a single ant file or shell script. I don&#8217;t have to be alive to meet this goal.

  * Engage more with business customers.

If one of my developers talks to a salesperson in the hallway, check, done.

  * Deliver 5 projects.

No one said they had to be big projects, maybe a small production bug fix counts as a project. Again a team could probably do this without any manager.

  * Perform maintenance on System X.

Everyone has maintenance, check.

The guys at Manager tools have a really simple model. The goal just has to be measurable and time based. Thus the goals become:

  * Automate all projects with maven by November 15.
  * Meet a rating of good or better with an annual survey of customer satisfaction for internal customers by September 1st.
  * Deliver Project X with less than 10 severe bugs by May 25th.
  * Reduce maintenance costs on System X by 50% by December 30th.
