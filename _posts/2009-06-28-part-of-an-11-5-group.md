I&#8217;m now part of 11.5% of all California workers looking for work. My organization decided strategically that they didn&#8217;t want to do in-house development, hence they didn&#8217;t need a development manager. I just wish I had gotten a longer chance to show the significant quality and cost benefits of maintaining a development team in-house.

There is shock as you realize your routine has changed. It settles down after a few days. Next came the silver lining that comes with this sort of change:

  * Doing coding katas every morning to tighten up my programming chops. I&#8217;m alternating between doing solutions in Ruby, Java, and Groovy.
  * Looking at options to do something I&#8217;ve been passionate about like Agile coaching, QA management, or old fashioned professional services.
  * Attending some conferences and user groups in the Bay area since I have some travel time.
  * Reviewing some open source projects I always wanted to contribute to.
  * Catching up with friends in Sacramento over lunch.
  * Hanging out with my two daughters including picking them up on bikes last week.

Sacramento isn&#8217;t the biggest tech market and it&#8217;s home to the state of California government and their massive budget issues, but I&#8217;m confident I&#8217;ll find a good opportunity.
