I launched my first Ruby gem a few days ago, [yertle_formatter](https://rubygems.org/gems/yertle_formatter). It&#8217;s a custom RSpec 3 formatter that prints out turtles for slow specs and then lists them in order of slowest specs.

I worked out a lot of experiments with:

  * [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/edgibbs/yertle_formatter)
  * [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org)
  * [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/edgibbs/yertle_formatter)
  * [Pull Review](https://www.pullreview.com/github/edgibbs/yertle_formatter/reviews/master)

With 2015 ahead I may be working on some new gems soon. As a first gem goes, writing a formatter was a nice way to get started and published.
