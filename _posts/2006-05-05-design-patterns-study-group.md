Sometimes you really get a sense that things are going well from your staff. Today was one of those days.

I&#8217;ve been sending some of my more senior developers to conferences with the plan to expand their vision of software development. Sort of you don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know until you&#8217;re exposed to it.

Coming back from one of those conferences one tech lead got very excited about design patterns. It took a while since he had quite a workload, but he just helped run a 3 hour session with another developer introducing design patterns and covering **Strategy** and **Factory Method**.

The initial session went off pretty well. They&#8217;ll probably refactor the format a bit, possibly going to more of a [study group](http://www.industriallogic.com/papers/learning.html#STUDY) versus lecture/lab style, but it is immensely satisfying to watch people grow the team.
