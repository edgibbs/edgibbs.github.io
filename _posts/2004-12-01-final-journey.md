T-6 days

Only 6 days to go until I head into the hospital. I feeling pretty good right now in the nauseau is almost completely gone. Unfortunately I aquired a cold on Sunday so I&#8217;m sniffiling and taking a lot of sudafed. The doctors and nurses assure me the cold shouldn&#8217;t make a difference. Everything&#8217;s still on schedule.

The stem cell collection went swimmingly. It only took 1 day of collection, which is basically sitting in a chair hooked up a rather large machine to get twice as much stem cells as they&#8217;ll need. Everyone tells me thats a good sign, I can produce a lot of stem cells which comes in handy after the last nuking with chemo when I&#8217;m in the hospital. Apparently the average collection is 2.7 days.

Micki informed my that my nephew Zak, who&#8217;s 4, was very upset when he saw a picture of me with no hair. His mom had told him about the cancer and that I was sick a few times, but it didn&#8217;t really sink in for him. It&#8217;s hard to explain these things to 4 year olds. I still wonder how worried Kassie really is, she looked at me with big saucer brown eyes while they changed the bandages on my PICC line today at the infusion center. I think she worries a lot more than she lets on. Still she played the waving game hiding behind the nurse and waving as she changed the bandages.

And I saw &#8216;The Incredibles&#8217; over the weekend, very nice to see a movie and be out again. Unfortunately it was a little to intense for Kassie, she&#8217;s been having nightmares about it sense. Sometimes experiments don&#8217;t work out for parents.

I&#8217;m just really looking forward to having the whole episode behind me soon.
