I remember searching hard for good technical podcasts about a year ago. There were really just a few at that point like [Drunk and Retired](http://drunkandretired.com/podcast/), [ZDot](http://timshadel.com/), and the [Polymorphic Podcast](http://polymorphicpodcast.com/). Today there&#8217;s a wealth of them. Just following a blog link I noticed NetObjectives has a Lean Agile Straight Talk [podcast](http://feeds.feedburner.com/NetObjectivesPodcast_LAST).

All this means is I have about 48 hours of backlog right on the old iPod and I can afford to be picky. A lot of podcasts I would have listened to on [IT Conversations](http://www.itconversations.com/index.html) now don&#8217;t even warrant a download.
