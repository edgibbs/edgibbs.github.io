I run a semi-regular development architecture meeting that involves pretty much all of my company&#8217;s senior java developers. On the agenda today was how to drive TDD into the development group successfully. Though not unexpected I got lots of the following:

  * Well, if you want us to write lots of unit tests it&#8217;s going to take a lot longer.
  * I&#8217;m really not sold on testing. I&#8217;m an old school developer, you&#8217;ll really have to convince me.
  * We should buy the developers a unit testing book and expect them to read it, no that probably won&#8217;t work.
  * I hate writing tests first because you&#8217;re just going to change the code and then you have to change the tests, it&#8217;s just a lot of grunt work.

The end result is right now out of the 6 senior developers in the room, only one of them has become test infected, and he can often fall back into bad habits given some time pressure. I just hope the presentations, seminars, and pair programming I&#8217;m about to embark on is successful.
