My BS radar goes off when conversations turn to standards and best practices. I find James Bach&#8217;s [argument](http://blackbox.cs.fit.edu/blog/james/archives/000187.html) quite convincing especially his point about industry best practices:

>   * &#8220;This practice represents a consensus among industry leaders.&#8221;
> No it doesn&#8217;t. You&#8217;re just making that up. Industry leaders aren&#8217;t able to agree on anything much of substance. I know this because I am an industry leader (based on the fact that some people have said so), and other leaders more often disagree with me instead of obeying my commands. I am influential within a certain clique. The software testing industry is made up of many such tiny cliques, each with its own terminology and values. </ul> </blockquote>

> Standards are far too often used as hammers to enforce an individual&#8217;s ideas. They can quickly stifle creativity and lead to ludicrous decisions like using EJB&#8217;s for every project because that&#8217;s the industry best practice we&#8217;re following.

> In [Peopleware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleware) the alternate recommendation is to tend towards a &#8220;gently guided convergence&#8221; over hammering people with declared best practices. There ideas are:
> 
> >   * _Training:_ People do what they know how to do. If you given them all a common core of methods, they will tend to use those methods.
> >   * _Tools:_ A few automated aids for modeling, design, implementation, and test will get you more convergence of method then all the statutes you can pass.
> >   * _Peer Review:_ In organizations where there are active peer review mechanisms (quality circles, walkthroughs, inspections, technology fairs), there is a natural tendency toward convergence.
