Apparently the Java developers market in Sacramento is heating up these days with about 20+ positions largely contracting for between $45-$75/hr. On that note one of the developers in the audience mentioned that he was doing a lot of interviewing and that bringing actual code on a laptop to an interview would really impress him, though he hadn&#8217;t seen anyone actually do that. As a hiring manager I can vouch that I would be impressed with someone who did that in an interview.

Beyond that at the [SACJUG](http://www.sacjug.org/) meeting [Nick Chalko](http://nick.chalko.com/smc2/blog/) did a good overview of the TPTP plugin for Eclipse 3.2. Some of my developers are starting to look more into profiling so the overview was helpful. I&#8217;ve also heard that the new NetBeans has a really nice profiler.
