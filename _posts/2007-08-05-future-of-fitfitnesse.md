We&#8217;re still using Fitnesse and its coming in quite handy for testing over 100 edits on some code we inherited. I still wonder how much it will catch on. [Jeremey Miller](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/07/30/is-there-a-future-for-fit-testing.aspx) has been thinking along the same lines: 

> Long term, all the testing gurus I know of seem to be driving towards scripting tests in Ruby and I&#8217;m thinking of moving in that direction in the future. I&#8217;ll still use Fit tests for set-based logic where it excels, but otherwise it just seems, I don&#8217;t know, clunky.

I think FIT/Fitnesse gets a lot less use than your average JUnit framework, but the download numbers suggest Fitnesse is catching on:

  * fitnesse20070619.zip **2551**
  * fitnesse20060719.zip **78608**
  * fitnesse20050731.zip **17551**

The numbers for the 2006 version show some real promise. Hopefully the idea of automating acceptance tests is becoming a more widespread practice.
