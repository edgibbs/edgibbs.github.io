I budgeted this year for dual 20&#8243; monitors or one 24&#8243; monitor for each developer. With prices dropping now maybe we can go to a single [30&#8243;](http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?sku=222-0863&cs=19&c=us&l=en). Keeping your IDE, a browser, a terminal window, and an email client certainly helps with productivity.
