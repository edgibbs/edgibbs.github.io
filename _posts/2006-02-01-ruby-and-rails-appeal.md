The appeal of simple is mind numbingly obvious. This comes from the [Labnotes](http://blog.labnotes.org/2006/01/21/language-barriers/) and apparently originates from [jutopic](http://jutopia.tirsen.com/articles/2005/10/28/why-ruby-on-rails).

I&#8217;d argue that Martin Fowler&#8217;s _Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture_ could apply to both though it doesn&#8217;t have Ruby example code for any of the patterns.
