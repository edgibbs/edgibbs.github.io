Just held the review today for the end of Sprint #6 on an intranet portal project. We&#8217;re pretty much down to Sprint #7 and then we can finally release it on the employees. Along the way we&#8217;ve learned the following things:

  * Websphere Portal 5.1.0.3 and especially it&#8217;s content management features (WCM) are fairly primitive and not that well integrated for maintaining a content site with 40+ contributers.
  * Having 4 different product owners over the life of the project makes it difficult to stay headed in a single direction. Luckily the last remaining product owner has been working directly on the team for the last three or four sprints.
  * Estimating and tracking many of the work items are difficult. How do you estimate how many training classes you need, and how do you know when you&#8217;re done? How many items are just pure timeboxed research into possible intranet features? And at the review meeting how do you demonstrate new functionality when say 60% of the Sprint was setting up and running training classes.
  * Intranet projects are inherently political beasts. Everyone has a vested interest or even lack of interest in how their division&#8217;s content is organized. You will end up in some huge conflicts despite all possible precautions.
  * Many normal Agile related practices are non-existent. TDD, continuous builds, refactoring just don&#8217;t apply.
