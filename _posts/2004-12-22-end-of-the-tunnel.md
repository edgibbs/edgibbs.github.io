White Blood Cell Counts are up

Great news today. After 8 days of waiting my counts have finally gone from less than 0.1 to 0.2 officially. So my stem cells are actually producing white blood cells again. I know they might go up and down a little from here, but this is great news. When they get to about 1.0 they let me go home and break out of my HEPA filtered prison. Home will then be the next great adventure.
