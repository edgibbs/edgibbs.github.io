Since my ScrumMaster training class is in Seattle of all places, it would appear that many of my fellow classmates are Microsofties. Should be interesting to see how Scrum adoption is going in their shop especially given [the uproar from MS](http://edgibbs.com/2005/11/24/microsoft-reverses-on-misleading-tdd-documentation/) recently defining TDD as write a bunch of tests upfront for a class you&#8217;ve already written and then get them to pass one by one. At least they went to the trouble of removing it after some uproar. Still a lot of people still can be impressed when you mention that Microsoft is doing Agile/Scrum.

I remember using this a lot when I worked at a consulting company that mainly did [ATG Dynamo](http://www.atg.com/) implementations. Well if Sony, Reuters, and Sun can use it, it certainly will work for you.
