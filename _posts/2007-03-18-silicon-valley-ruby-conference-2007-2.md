SD Forums opened up the registration for the [Silicon Valley Ruby Conference](http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=2135&mo=4&yr=2007) a few days ago. So far they&#8217;ve got:

  * [Charles Nutter](http://headius.blogspot.com/) and [Thomas Enebo](http://www.bloglines.com/blog/ThomasEEnebo): The [JRuby](http://jruby.codehaus.org/) Guys from Sun Microsystems
  * Asuman Suenbuel: SAP
  * [Josh Susser](http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/): Powerset &#8220;Ruby and Rails&#8221;
  * Tom Preston-Werner: &#8220;[Chronic](http://chronic.rubyforge.org/)&#8221; 

It&#8217;s April 21 and 22, but no location announced yet. But JRuby, Rails, and a natural langauge date/time library sound like good enough topics to me. I signed up tonight. I haven&#8217;t been able to take advantage of being so close to the Bay area since I last went to a Web 2001 conference six years ago. Geek weekend.
