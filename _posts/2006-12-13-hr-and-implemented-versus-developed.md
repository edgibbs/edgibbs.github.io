A recruiter from Tek Systems attends our local Sacramento Java Users Group (SacJUG) told a humorous and depressing story. It went a little like this:

**HR Rep:** Well, it doesn&#8217;t say here they developed any J2EE systems.
  
**External Recruiter:** It says designed and implemented two large J2EE ecommerce systems.
  
**HR Rep:** But that doesn&#8217;t mean they developed it.
  
**External Recruiter:** Implementing it means they developed it.
  
**HR Rep:** No, they might have only designed it and then deployed the final program, other people could have developed it.
  
**External Recruiter:** So if it said &#8220;designed, developed, and implemented&#8221; you&#8217;d be willing to interview them?
  
**HR Rep:** Yes.

The recruiter then explained that despite this frustrating conversation, developers would still be happy there because it&#8217;s just an HR hurdle and the development managers know what they&#8217;re doing. His advice was just to tailor the resume to mention all possible technologies and add words like developed. This way you don&#8217;t add extra hassle for the manager to get your resume out of HR.

For me this seriously flips the bozo bit. Even if I worked at a large Fortune 500 company I wouldn&#8217;t let HR own my hiring process. The minute you&#8217;re letting HR do screening for all but the most basic requirements you&#8217;re in danger of losing some of your best candidates. A rock star developer who has to deal with ridiculous HR flak will very often simply walk away from even a high paying opportunity. 

To avoid this you write your own job descriptions for postings and don&#8217;t get to hung up on must haves especially around technology. You&#8217;re looking for the best developers even if they don&#8217;t have 2 years experience with JSF or SOA experience. You explain to HR that you want to see all the resumes. I can rip through a lot of bad resumes in a few minutes and I have to live with the eventual hire for years so there&#8217;s plenty of self-interest at work. Getting the best candidates is partially a sales job on your working environment, you as a manager, and their potential fellow developers. 

Letting HR do a lot of pre-screening is just a bad idea for high end technical hires.
