I&#8217;m not sure why, but as an organization we often have wordy Sprint goals that take up half a page and include all sorts of obvious qualifiers like &#8220;will be deployed and tested to QA with no serious defects.&#8221; The backlog items are squeezed into tortured sentences and stuck up somewhere in the team room. These sort of goals are ineffective. No one can remember them. Have a goal like &#8220;Have the CEO order a new widget&#8221; are a lot easier to get behind.

A developer reminded me of a good rule of thumb from [Scrum and XP from the Trenches](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches) by Henrik Kniberg:

> The sprint goal should answer the fundamental question &ldquo;Why are we doing this sprint? Why don&rsquo;t we all just go on vacation instead?&rdquo;. In fact, one way to wheedle a sprint goal out of the product owner is to literally ask that question.
