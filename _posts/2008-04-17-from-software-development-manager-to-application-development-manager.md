This week I started fresh with a new company and a new title. After four years as a Software Development Manager and a short stint as an Enterprise Architecture Manager I&#8217;ve now returned to managing a group of internal IT developers. The current title is Application Development Manager.

The new organization is full of opportunities and challenges. Some of these include:

  * Inheriting a senior development team.
  * An organization which is still early in the process of formulating practices and process.
  * High level support for process improvement a mix of CMMI, ITIL, PMI, and a bit of RUP at present.
  * Systems with real high availability requirements.
  * A JBoss shop.
  * A QA team pushing hard to push for quality throughout the project and not just at the end. Plus they&#8217;re doing automation and load/performance tuning.
  * Developers self-organizing a weekly gathering to discuss software topics.

I wake up about 5 am these days to go for a walk every morning. These days it&#8217;s a lot easier to bounce up and not just hit the snooze button. If I can get Perforce setup with a Hudson plugin I might just set up a continuous build box tomorrow.
