Carl Quinn, a development manager at Google and a member of the [Java Posse](http://www.javaposse.com/), mentioned that he spent about 50% of his time on code reviews. Google even has a special [code review tool](http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/11/google-mondrian.html), Mondrian, developed by [Guido van Rossum](http://www.python.org/~guido/). The features are similar to [Crucible](http://www.cenqua.com/crucible/).

Google&#8217;s warm embrace of lightweight code reviews sets a nice bar. We&#8217;ve heard for decades that code reviews or inspections are great for removing defects, keeping the code base maintainable, and mentoring. But&#8230;

  * There&#8217;s no time, we have code to write.
  * I have a healthy ego, I&#8217;m not comfortable with my peers giving me feedback.
  * My code already works, it even passes those unit tests I wrote at the end.
  * Code reviews are just about individual style, not worth the time.
  * We&#8217;ll pair program then we don&#8217;t have to do code reviews. Oh, you mean I have to sit with another developer and share a machine? Let me think about those code reviews again.
  * Code reviews, those aren&#8217;t Agile.

Can Google&#8217;s example win over more developers?
