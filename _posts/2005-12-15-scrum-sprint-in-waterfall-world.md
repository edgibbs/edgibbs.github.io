We&#8217;re very much in the early adoption of Scrum at this point in my organization. So while my group of developers commonly run Sprints, hold daily standups, and use product backlogs, the rest of the organization rarely follows along.

So we ran into one of these clashes today on one project. The second Sprint will finish up successfully tomorrow, but then we go into a QA/UA cycle for a few weeks where they&#8217;re really won&#8217;t be any development.

Our solution for now is to do a sort of 2-3 week release Sprint where we work off a lot of design debt on the project. Due to the number of new technologies used on the project the amount of unit test coverage is pretty low, about 5-10% actually, plenty of debt.
