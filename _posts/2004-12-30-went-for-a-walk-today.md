After 24 days inside, I got permission today from my doctor to go for walks. I took him up on it this afternoon and walked for about 25 minutes with the new iPod. It felt great to stretch the legs again. I actually sweated, which I haven&#8217;t done since I had a fever. For the statisticians my WBC is up to 1.6 and my platelets are up to 66 so I&#8217;m in little danger of bleeding to death. I can feel my vision expanding again. It&#8217;s less day to day and more what am I going to do next week or next month. I&#8217;m looking forward to a trip to the redwoods in Northern California. I always had trouble believing that picture of the highway going through a redwood tree, and now I finally get a chance to see it.

I feel exceptionally lucky to have gone through this pretty much unscathed with a great amount of help from my wife, my Mom, my Mother in law, my Dad, my Father in law, my brothers, all the members of Gibbscrew, the many people at EDFUND who have only known me briefly, and the neighbors here in East Sac who have baked for us, babysat the kids, and generally raised our spirits. I&#8217;ve even been helped by my little 4 year old nephew who drew me a wonderful robot picture for my hospital wall. Then my doctors and nurses who have done there jobs and more.

And tonight I have a favorite job to do, Micki and Joan are making me cookies, and I am in charge of quality control. You have to sample at least 1 or 2 from every batch with a large helping of milk.

Oh I even got [my story](http://www.giveyourblood.com/transfusion_ed.html) added to a site to encourage blood transfusions.
