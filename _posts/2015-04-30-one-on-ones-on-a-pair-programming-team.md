One-on-Ones are a well known management strategy. They help reduce communication misses, keep everyone on course and provide an easy platform for feedback. I&#8217;ve done them throughout my management career, but the past few years I had a few start and stops with them. 

My scenario over the past few years has been working as an engineer and often a tech lead on small teams where we paired as much as 80%. Sitting side by side and rotating pairs often led me to experiment with skipping out on one on ones. If you&#8217;re having regular conversations over the code, do one-on-ones serve enough of a purpose?

I decided they were important enough to restart after my first year on the new job. Part of my reluctance was the need to come up to speed on a number of technologies. I skimped on spending time for tactical management tasks. I relished staying deep in the code and design, but I should still have carved out the time for one-on-ones.

When I transitioned to leading a new team about 6 months ago I again let the one-on-ones slip off my radar. I told myself I would restart them after I felt out the new team. Turned out I got lazy and took 6 months to restart them. Even on teams that pair and sit in close proximity, some conversations never come up and it&#8217;s rare to discuss items like career aspirations when the whole team is housed at one long table.

I have made a single adjustment from my old style where I ran 30 minute one-on-ones once a week. For my current team:

  * Scheduled for 30 minutes.
  * Most of the agenda is up to the employee, and sometimes we discuss future career type goals.
  * The last 5-10 minutes are for me, news I need to pass on or lightweight feedback.
  * Generally the one-on-ones average about 15 minutes, but they&#8217;re still scheduled for the full 30.
  * I rotate through all of them one after the other so with 3 we&#8217;re often done after about an hour.
  * If we miss a week for some reason it&#8217;s not a big deal, since these are weekly.
