[Tim Shadel](http://timshadel.com/blog/) has a post entitled, [JSF: The 7-Layer Burrito I Won&#8217;t Eat Again](http://timshadel.com/blog/2006/01/19/jsf-the-7-layer-burrito-i-wont-eat-again/), and podcast on his experience with JSF. I&#8217;m guessing the 7 layer burrito comment refers to the 6 lifecycle phases in JSF. Anyway I&#8217;m eagerly awaiting to get to this podcast on my iTunes playlist. Tim&#8217;s vote on JSF after his team has used it for about a year, &#8220;Skip it.&#8221;

Our experience has been pretty mixed with JSF. We&#8217;ve had trouble finding decent books, trainers or resources despite the hype surrounding JSF. Out of six developers on our development teams that have actually used JSF on a project I get:

  * One positive vote.
  * Two less positive votes with a lot of caveats.
  * One neutral vote.
  * Two very negative votes.

If I had my choice I would still be adopting wait and see on JSF, but some consultants were pushing it so it became a non-functional requirement on some new projects. I think JSF may prove out, but it could just as easily go the way of EJB entity beans.
