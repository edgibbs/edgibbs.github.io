We just can&#8217;t get any of our Scrum teams to agree to a small penalty for arriving late to daily standups. Three official projects now and all of them have turned down the idea of having a cup with $1 donations if you show up late, aka a container of charity. 

I plan on trying to get it agreed to on my next unofficial Scrum project, but it may not be part of our culture. We definitely have the late meetings complex that plagues just about anyplace.
