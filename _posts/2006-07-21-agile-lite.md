Yesterday my organization invented a new Agile methodology&#8211;Agile Lite! You might recognize it as Scrum minus collocation.

  * 30 Day Sprints
  * Planning Meetings
  * Product Backlogs
  * Review Meetings
  * Sprint Backlog
  * Daily Standups
  * Scrum Master
  * Product Owner

The name is a bit humorous, but as long as we get to run it as an Agile/Scrum project I&#8217;m not really very concerned about the actual name we use. The best part these days is the strongest proponents of doing Scrum projects are the customers. They really enjoy the control over the direction of the project it allows them.
