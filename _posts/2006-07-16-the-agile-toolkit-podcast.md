It&#8217;s not the most updated technical podcast around, not the most polished sounding, and follows pretty much just an interview format, but I really like when the occasional new [Agile Toolkit](http://agiletoolkit.libsyn.com/) episode pops up. The host Bob Payne follows a simple format:

  * Attend a conference.
  * Corner as many good speakers as you can.
  * Get them to sit down for about 30 minutes and just talk.

Almost all the guests are from two conferences, Agile 2005 and No Fluff Just Stuff Northern Virgina 2006. The guests range from [Bob Martin](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob) to [Jared Richardson](http://jaredrichardson.net/) of [Ship It!](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/prj/). I&#8217;m hoping Bob gets the chance to attend a few more conferences this year.
