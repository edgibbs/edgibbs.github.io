As I&#8217;ve mentioned before our adoption of TDD is going slower than I would have anticipated. I&#8217;ve actually been religiously posting unit test counts on the wall of my cube for an entire Sprint now and we&#8217;ve gone from zero to 39 unit tests in that amount of time. Since that amounts to about a 10% unit test coverage in Clover we have a long way to go.

I don&#8217;t think the daily chart has done much to accelerate things, but now that the two developers on the project have a chance to catch their breath, I have seen that they&#8217;re paying a bit more attention to the clover reports especially the green bar. Now they&#8217;re saying they want to get to at least 50% on the reports and move the green bar up from it&#8217;s current lowly 10%. It&#8217;s even occurred to them that they can boost their percentage on Clover by setting a lot of properties in the beans. This isn&#8217;t exactly the outcome I want, but it does show they&#8217;re starting to think about how they can increase their unit testing coverage.

Similar to the short cycles of TDD itself, we&#8217;re starting to make those baby steps.
