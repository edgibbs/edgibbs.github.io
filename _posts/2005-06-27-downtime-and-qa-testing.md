A problem that crops up over and over again in my world is that a developer or two completes their coding assignments on a project and the project moves into a formal testing cycle. If the developer has done a quality job and done a lot of unit testing the code base is likely to be in pretty good shape with few bugs. Still since it can take testers quite a while to test they end up with bench time waiting around for the few bugs that do come in.

Typically the developer has some research/cleanup items that can occupy a couple of days, but then comes the idle time. If I can&#8217;t find some new work quickly they become tempted to &#8216;add&#8217; functionality which can be a dangerous game, or merely get bored idling. I&#8217;m still working on ways to get around this, but it appears to be a persistent problem. My guess is as we experiment with pulling in QA really early in the development process and help them write tests, that we&#8217;ll see less of this problem in the future. I certainly hope so.
