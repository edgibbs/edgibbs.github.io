I&#8217;m off to my first open space conference later this month at Open Agile California. Should be a great chance to recharge some batteries and talk about issues with sustaining agile. I know after three years of Agile and two years of our official effort that we no longer do a lot of questioning and looking outward for new ideas. I&#8217;m focused on how you re-energize an organization at this phase, especially when many of the original high level sponsors of the effort have moved on.
