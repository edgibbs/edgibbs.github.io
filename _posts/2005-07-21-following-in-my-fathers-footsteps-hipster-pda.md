I realized on a short trip back home, that I&#8217;ve currently adopted a habit of my Dad. He&#8217;s an electrical engineer by training, and he picked up programming pretty early on. I still remember he actually used pocket protectors, built his own television, and proudly showed me his slide rules.

Anyway as early as I can remember my father carried around a .5 mm pencil and a little 3&#215;5 spiral notebook. Lately I found myself frustrated with trying to track things on a Palm Pilot, a Mac, and a Dell laptop that blue screens about once a day. So I reverted to a, [Hipster PDA](http://merlin.blogs.com/43folders/2004/09/introducing_the.html), basically a stack of 3&#215;5 cards with my lists on them. 

After 3 weeks now it&#8217;s working pretty well. Of course this means I have to admit to myself that my Dad was onto something that I largely ignored for twenty odd years.

Management wise I find that keeping my major projects on an easy to modify 3&#215;5 cards helps me stay on top of things. When you have 5 or 6 projects that comes in pretty handy. And because they&#8217;re always in sync reviewing them a few times a day is a lot easier which means I do it more often and stay on top of things better. I struggle a bit with it when I have 8 out of 10 items done on a card and I have to move the two items to a new card manually, but it does lead to another review.

The really nice thing is when I do a weekly review of everything I can spread out all my 3&#215;5 project cards across my desk and get a good big picture idea of where I am. And the low tech 3&#215;5 cards and lists fit in well with Agile ideas like information radiators, CRC cards, product backlogs, and adapting to changing priorities.
