I&#8217;m not sure anyone else will find this of much use, but the following is a list of tools, frameworks and libraries we use currently:

**Java Frameworks**

  * JSF 1.0
  * MyFaces
  * AJAX Anywhere
  * Spring
  * Hibernate
  * iBATIS
  * JUnit
  * EasyMock
  * Log4J
  * JODA Time
  * Struts (Though just for one 3rd party app and some older applications)

**Tools**

  * RAD 6.0 (We&#8217;re a Websphere shop these days)
  * IntelliJ IDEA ( Was the editor of choice before Websphere, still used occasionally)
  * Hudson (our current continuous build tool)
  * Confluence
  * HSQLDB (for in memory testing)
  * Crucible
  * Clover
  * Fisheye
  * CVS
  * Tomcat
  * WAS 6.0
  * Websphere Portal 5.1
  * Websphere Process Server
  * Ant
  * Maven 2 (Used for one or two projects at this point)
  * Checkstyle
  * PMD
  * FindBugs
  * Fitnesse

**Practices**

  * Scrum (30 day Sprints)
  * Test Driven Development (We&#8217;re still working on this, most unit tests are still written after the code.)
  * Lightweight Code Reviews
  * Domain Driven Design (Really just getting started here.)
  * Continuous Integration
  * AOP (But just a little bit with Spring 2.0)
  * Use Cases
  * Automated Acceptance Tests (Again, just getting started here.)
