[Confluence](http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/) is available for a free license for non-profits who can&#8217;t afford to pay. Our local java users group ([SACJUG](http://www.sacjug.org/)) fit the bill for this, though no one&#8217;s ever been quite organized enough to officially register as a non-profit.

At the last SACJUG meeting we debated over what wiki/content management system to use and eventually settled on Confluence. The feeling was as a java users group we needed to use a Java based tool. I volunteered to see if they&#8217;d grant a license since my company is already a Confluence customer. About a week later I got a nice email from Atlassian granting SACJUG the right to use Confluence for site.

Kudos to Atlassian for the program for non-profits. And if you&#8217;ve tried several wikis and they never caught on you might try out Confluence. It&#8217;s really [taken off](http://edgibbs.com/2006/04/15/making-a-decision-on-confluence/) in our organization and the pricing is really reasonable.
