We had a conference call today with some IBM Websphere specialists on an issue we&#8217;re having with intra-portlet communication. They have been gently hinting that their customers should move to JSR-168 because they&#8217;re taking out the IBM portlet API. Still with enterprise software vendors you figure this will be a very slow process. Verbally today they made it quite clear that they plan on moving to JSR-168 aggressively, and that in Websphere Portal 6.0 they&#8217;re actually deprecating IBM portlets in favor of JSR-168. The mentioned the word **deprecated** at least four or five times in a short discussion around the topic.

Just to prove that they&#8217;re an enterprise vendor at heart they did explain that they&#8217;re also pushing [SDO](http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=34216) (Service Data Objects), which is no longer a JSR, (or at least an active JSR) but more of a push by an &#8220;industry consortium&#8221;. How that plays out is still an open question.
