I&#8217;ve had a pretty good run of luck grabbing a colleague to look at my code. The last four or five times it&#8217;s been a classic rubber duck case. 

**Me:** So here I&#8217;m stubbing out the partials in this view spec since I only want to test this conditional logic.
  
**Colleague:** OK.
  
**Me:** So it keeps failing when I stub the partials and pulling the in anyway even though it works in similar cases. See I&#8217;m just pulling in &#8216;/users&#8217;.
  
**Me:** Oh, I probably don&#8217;t need that forward slash in users.
  
**Me:** Thanks again.

If you don&#8217;t regularly grab someone to look over your shoulder on a frustrating problem, you might want to start the practice. You can even use a [real rubber duck](http://www.rubberduckdebugging.com) and explain it to them, but for me it seems to work better with a real person.
