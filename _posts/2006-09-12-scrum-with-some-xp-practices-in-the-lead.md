Recently Brian Marick posted on [Scrum + XP practices](http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2006/09/11#pragmatist-hump) being the default Agile methodology:

> The gorilla of Agile is Scrum + a selection of XP practices

This gels with my experience as well. Most of the Agile practitioners I know are using Scrum with at least some XP practices, and a few are using straight XP. Beyond that I don&#8217;t have a lot of exposure to other Agile methodologies.

I do realize that my experience may be badly skewed. I assume the appeal of Scrum is that it&#8217;s a pretty lightweight project management methodology which almost assumes you&#8217;ll be doing some XP practices. XP is harder to fully adapt since it prescribes things like pair programming that are typically a harder sell.

I have seen some counter evidence from Scott Ambler&#8217;s Agile [survey](http://www.ddj.com/dept/architect/191800169;?pgno=2):

  * Agile MSF **191**
  * Agile Unified Process (AUP) **216**
  * Crystal Clear **91**
  * Dynamic System Development Method (DSDM) **26**
  * Extreme Programming (XP) **954**
  * Feature Driven Development (FDD) **502**
  * Scrum **460**
  * Other **171**

Scrum doesn&#8217;t do too badly, but it&#8217;s only 18% of the total. XP makes up 37% and FDD is 19%. Maybe Scrum isn&#8217;t the default just yet. And things have a long ways to evolve still so we&#8217;ll see is Scrum + some XP practices really becomes the most common Agile process over the next few years.
