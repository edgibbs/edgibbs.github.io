Listening to an [interview](http://www.se-radio.net/index.php?post_id=157593) on Software Engineering Radio with Amazon&#8217;s CTO, Werner Vogels, a novel idea to chartering a project was explained. At Amazon instead of the traditional project charter or having a team just start with playing around with new technology, they require as a first step that the team writes a press release for the new feature. That way the new features on Amazon always start out focusing on how to appeal to the user. I&#8217;ve been exposed to this before with Luke Hohmann&#8217;s [Product Box](http://www.enthiosys.com/igproductbox.php) game. Might be great idea to try one of our next projects.
