I came across a slightly more [detailed explanation](http://www.step-10.com/process/FDDToTheRescue.html) of how to write feature titles in FDD, basically:

<pre>&lt;action&gt;&lt;result&gt;&lt;object&gt;</pre>

So an example would be, **Add an Item to the Shopping Cart** or **Calculate Total Registrations for Class**. Having just gone through an exercise of planning out some features and estimating &#8216;story points&#8217; on a project, this makes a lot of sense. It seems to reinforce that they are small task level items instead of things like full Use Cases such as **Manage Customer Orders** or **Build Giant Report**. I&#8217;ll have to try this out with the next Scrum product backlog list I develop.
