The doctor just came by, and said I could go home tomorrow assuming when they pull my antibiotics today that I don&#8217;t develop any fevers! Yes, escape!!! If it works out Dec 28th would be exactly the day I predicted for getting out. I&#8217;m doing my happy dance now, and no it won&#8217;t be recorded.
