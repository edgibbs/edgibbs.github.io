When ideas become dogma:

> In Agile, the developers have to sit at the end of the row along the open hallway when everyone&#8217;s collocated. The business analysts have to be in the middle because they have to communicate with everyone.

In other words there&#8217;s a seating chart for an Agile team area. Or, 

> Sprints are always 30 days. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the product owner and the Scrum Master and half the team isn&#8217;t available, you can&#8217;t add a day to the project. That isn&#8217;t Agile.

And I thought the principal was responding a change over following a plan.
