Some recent signs of continuous testing coming to Java land:

  * [Grails 1.](http://grails.org/Roadmap)1 features 9 new features including **#9 Continuous Testing**.
  * Kent Beck is developing [JUnit Max](http://www.junitmax.com/junitmax/subscribe.html) an Eclipse plug-in that runs tests in the background optimizing for the tests that are most likely to break.

Autotest was a joy to use when I got to spend more time playing with Rails. Maybe I won&#8217;t have to miss it that much longer.
