I got blindsided by some consultants today explaining that we would be implementing SDO for our ORM layer. I&#8217;d barely heard of it and it has almost zilcho profile in the general J2EE community. Apparently I&#8217;m being overruled by said consultants.

So I did a little 10 minute research on service data objects versus Hibernate:

  * Number of books on Hibernate on Amazon.com: 8
  * Number of books on Service Data Objects on Amazon.com: 1 (An IBM Redbook)
  * Number of jobs on Monster.com listing Hibernate: 373
  * Number of jobs on Monster.com listing Service Data Objects: 1
