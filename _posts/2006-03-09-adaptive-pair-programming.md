We actually have some pair programming going on within one of our current projects. It evolved pretty naturally and not as some grand plan. There were two developers, one feature to work on that has requirements, and one developer who needed more mentoring. They&#8217;re doing TDD and using mock objects. The mock DAO objects allow them to make more progress than relying on a JDBC interface to our legacy system. I may even get to pair with one of them tomorrow and write some tests as well as a nice Friday bonus.
