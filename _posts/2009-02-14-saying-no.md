> Say No. This is your second most powerful tool. Whether you&rsquo;re a manager, considering management, or just here for the Rands, I want you to pick the hardest problem on your plate. The one that is waking you up at 4am. I want you to decide and to say out loud:
> 
> &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
> 
> You&rsquo;re not going to do that thing. QA can&rsquo;t test it. Engineering won&rsquo;t finish it. If we attempt to do it, we will fail and we don&rsquo;t fail, so the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.

Rands spells out the importance of saying no. A critical point in plotting your strategy is saying no. After a good round of brainstorming you&#8217;re itching to start 5 different major initiatives. Maybe customers want to get started on new features as you&#8217;re still trying to launch weeks away from launching the baseline app.

The tough answer as a manager is often no. Agreeing to a impossible deadline and attempting to toss quality aside is bad for your team and bad for the organization. Saying no is the right thing here.
