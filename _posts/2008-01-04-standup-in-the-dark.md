The lights went out to work today after a winter storm rolled through Sacramento. In an agile spirit we still held one of our standups after moving near one of the windows. 

**Scrum Master:** &#8220;OK, anyone have anything to report?&#8221;
  
**Team Member #1:** &#8220;I was really productive right up until the lights went out.&#8221;
  
**Team Member #2:** &#8220;I have an impediment, no machine, and no light.&#8221;
  
**Team Member #3:** &#8220;Turns out I won&#8217;t need a migration to the QA server today.&#8221;
  
**Scrum Master:** &#8220;Oh, and the review is at 12:30 next week, and I&#8217;m scheduling the retrospective today if we get power.&#8221;
  
**Team Member #4:** &#8220;And you can add lunchtime sprint reviews to that list of things to look into right now.&#8221;
