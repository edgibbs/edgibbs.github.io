One of the developers on XPlanner, [Jacques Morel](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/~jacmorel), dropped me a comment on my post about my [Pain with XPlanner](http://edgibbs.com/2005/08/13/pain-with-xplanner/) post:

> 0.7 is very close (within a month) and has this problem solved.
  
> You can build it right now from subversion. It is rather stable (we release it every 2 weeks internally). I am scheduled to put out a beta anytime now.

So I&#8217;m a sucker for personal contact and open source tools, and I don&#8217;t really like spending much time in Excel. So it&#8217;s on my [Backpack](http://www.backpackit.com/) todo list for tomorrow, so assuming some fires don&#8217;t erupt at work I should be able to pull it down and try again. And of course this will force me to pull down a Windows subversion client at work, probably [Tortoise SVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/).
