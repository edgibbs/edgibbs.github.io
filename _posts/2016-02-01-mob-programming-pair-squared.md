I came across the idea of mob programming on an Elixir podcast, [Elixir Fountain](https://soundcloud.com/elixirfountain). Its pair programming on steroids, where you sit together and work on one problem together. There&#8217;s still just one driver at a time, though it rotates. There&#8217;s already a [web site](http://mobprogramming.org) and a [conference](http://www.mobprogrammingconference.com) based on it.

I like the concept, but I&#8217;m not sure how effective it would be as a constant practice. I&#8217;ve done exercises like mob programming in small doses on particularly hard problems that involve architecture choices and occasionally as an exercise at user group meet ups. Anecdotally I don&#8217;t see doing it most of the time, but it is possible it works as a regular practice. It&#8217;s different enough that it might need some further experiments.
