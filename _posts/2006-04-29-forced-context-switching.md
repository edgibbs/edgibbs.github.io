Sometimes, despite your best efforts you get forced to stretch a developer across more than one project. Johanna Rothman [posted](http://www.jrothman.com/weblog/2006/04/convincing-management-that-context.html) on this recently arguing that many managers just don&#8217;t get the difficulties of asking their people to multi-task. Sometime, I don&#8217;t really get a choice.

I&#8217;m very familiar with the pains of context switching since as a manager it&#8217;s often a part of my world. My day continuously involves getting pulled in to help review a prototype for a developer or talk a system admin giving us read access to log files. Since my job is to make my people more effective I can&#8217;t complain too much when I get interrupted.

Still things come up. Business owners request certain resources they emotionally feel are the only safe choice for a high profile project. As a development manager part of your responsibility is to work with your customers. If they are so attached to this opinion that you are unable to sway them, you&#8217;re forced to give them the resource they ask for even if it&#8217;s just to appear at meetings and help a bit with the coding.

Long term the customer should be convinced that the other developer who&#8217;s doing the bulk of the coding is perfectly capable of handling their high profile projects. Still in the short term you&#8217;re forced to split one of your developers across contexts and damage their own productivity. I haven&#8217;t found a better way to handle it, and in many ways I doubt I ever will.
