I&#8217;ve been looking for a nearby Ruby or Rails conference to attend for the last six months or so, and I finally spotted one this evening on [Josh Susser&#8217;s](http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2007/1/26/rfp-silicon-valley-ruby-conf-2007) blog. Turns out SD Forum is going to be running a weekend Ruby conference April 21st and 22nd. The details are still not all there including the all important cost one, but I&#8217;m reserving a spot on my calendar.
