> &#8220;No, really the standups worked, even with only 3 people they really helped everyone stay in sync.&#8221;

This was one one of my more sarcastic developers (sarcasm and software are so often synonymous) explaining that he actually saw value in standup meetings. Given a general hatred for meetings by your average developer it was nice to get some feedback that someone saw some value in them. I&#8217;ve noticed that I tend to have meetings on Tuesdays when the standups are scheduled and the team doesn&#8217;t tend to get together on their own and hold the meetings so I&#8217;d always taken that as partial evidence they didn&#8217;t completely buy into the standups. 

So it was nice to hear someone specifically explain that they were valuable to them. I suspect they don&#8217;t happen if I&#8217;m filling in as the ScrumMaster because there&#8217;s still some deference to my management position. I actually don&#8217;t think having only 4 standups a week is a big detriment, but it&#8217;s always struck me that it does break the rhythm up a bit.
