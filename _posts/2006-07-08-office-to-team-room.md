At the suggestion of a developer I&#8217;ve revisited the idea of turning my office into a true team room. After about 6 months in the cube farm my office is pretty much just used as a team room anyway. Here&#8217;s the current office:

The current layout has a few issues:

  * One whole wall is locked out from whiteboard/corkboards due to some cubicle bookshelves.
  * No table for longer meetings. It works fine for standups, but after 15 minutes you might want to sit down.
  * The shelves along the north wall block easy access to the corkboard, so people have to reach to move around there tasks into the &#8216;tested/done&#8217; column.

Here&#8217;s my team room concept:

With a little luck and the help of an admin who&#8217;s passionate about rethinking our space, I may be able to pull this off.
