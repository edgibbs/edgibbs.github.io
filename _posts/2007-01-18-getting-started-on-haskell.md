I made a little headway on Haskell today.

Downloaded the GHCI environment to start running/compiling in Haskell. Had to find the Mac Intel [port](http://haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_66.html#macosxintel). Went looking for at least a TextMate bundle, turns out there is a pretty basic [one](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2005/11/1/haskell-bundle-for-textmat) available. Then started one of the basic Haskell [tutorials](http://www.iceteks.com/articles.php/haskell/1).

After just an hour or so I feel like I&#8217;m on another planet, but that was the desired effect. Next up getting [HUnit](http://hunit.sourceforge.net/) up and running.
