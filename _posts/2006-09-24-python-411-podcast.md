One of the small podcast I&#8217;ve followed for at least a year now is [Python 411](http://www.awaretek.com/python/index.html). I haven&#8217;t actually coded in Python for years, but the host, [Ron Stephens](http://www.awaretek.com/weblog/) is just so excited about the topic that I still find I enjoy it. Passion is important.

My python story is simple, I picked it up around 1997 or 1998 specifically because Google was using it and I thought at the time they looked like a great company to work for. Unfortunately I never moved to the Bay area and pursued it before I had a whole family to consider. Professionally I used python for some customization work with [Infoseek&#8217;s UltraSeek](http://www.python.org/about/success/verity/) product.
